to the senate of the united states : 
 i have the satisfaction to communicate to the senate the results of the negotiations recently had in this city with the british minister , special and extraordinary .
these results comprise-- 
 first .
a treaty to settle and define the boundaries between the territories of the united states and the possessions of her britannic majesty in north america , for the suppression of the african slave trade , and the surrender of criminals fugitive from justice in certain cases .
second .
a correspondence on the subject of the interference of the colonial authorities of the british west indies with american merchant vessels driven by stress of weather or carried by violence into the ports of those colonies .
third .
a correspondence upon the subject of the attack and destruction of the steamboat caroline .
fourth .
a correspondence on the subject of impressment .
if this treaty shall receive the approbation of the senate , it will terminate a difference respecting boundary which has long subsisted between the two governments , has been the subject of several ineffectual attempts at settlement , and has sometimes led to great irritation , not without danger of disturbing the existing peace .
both the united states and the states more immediately concerned have entertained no doubt of the validity of the american title to all the territory which has been in dispute , but that title was controverted and the government of the united states had agreed to make the dispute a subject of arbitration .
one arbitration had been actually had , but had failed to settle the controversy , and it was found at the commencement of last year that a correspondence had been in progress between the two governments for a joint commission , with an ultimate reference to an umpire or arbitrator with authority to make a final decision .
that correspondence , however , had been retarded by various occurrences , and had come to no definite result when the special mission of lord ashburton was announced .
this movement on the part of england afforded in the judgment of the executive a favorable opportunity for making an attempt to settle this long - existing controversy by some agreement or treaty without further reference to arbitration .
it seemed entirely proper that if this purpose were entertained consultation should be had with the authorities of the states of maine and massachusetts .
letters , therefore , of which copies are herewith communicated , were addressed to the governors of those states , suggesting that commissioners should be appointed by each of them , respectively , to repair to this city and confer with the authorities of this government on a line by agreement or compromise , with its equivalents and compensations .
this suggestion was met by both states in a spirit of candor and patriotism and promptly complied with .
four commissioners on the part of maine and three on the part of massachusetts , all persons of distinction and high character , were duly appointed and commissioned and lost no time in presenting themselves at the seat of the government of the united states .
these commissioners have been in correspondence with this government during the period of the discussions ; have enjoyed its confidence and freest communications ; have aided the general object with their counsel and advice , and in the end have unanimously signified their assent to the line proposed in the treaty .
ordinarily it would be no easy task to reconcile and bring together such a variety of interests in a matter in itself difficult and perplexed , but the efforts of the government in attempting to accomplish this desirable object have been seconded and sustained by a spirit of accommodation and conciliation on the part of the states concerned , to which much of the success of these efforts is to be ascribed .
connected with the settlement of the line of the northeastern boundary , so far as it respects the states of maine and massachusetts , is the continuation of that line along the highlands to the northwesternmost head of connecticut river .
which of the sources of that stream is entitled to this character has been matter of controversy and of some interest to the state of new hampshire .
the king of the netherlands decided the main branch to be the northwesternmost head of the connecticut .
this did not satisfy the claim of new hampshire .
the line agreed to in the present treaty follows the highlands to the head of halls stream and thence down that river , embracing the whole claim of new hampshire and establishing her title to 100,000 acres of territory more than she would have had by the decision of the king of the netherlands .
by the treaty of 1783 the line is to proceed down the connecticut river to the forty - fifth degree of north latitude , and thence west by that parallel till it strikes the st. lawrence .
recent examinations having ascertained that the line heretofore received as the true line of latitude between those points was erroneous , and that the correction of this error would not only leave on the british side a considerable tract of territory heretofore supposed to belong to the states of vermont and new york , but also rouses point , the site of a military work of the united states , it has been regarded as an object of importance not only to establish the rights and jurisdiction of those states up to the line to which they have been considered to extend , but also to comprehend rouses point within the territory of the united states .
the relinquishment by the british government of all the territory south of the line heretofore considered to be the true line has been obtained , and the consideration for this relinquishment is to inure by the provisions of the treaty to the states of maine and massachusetts .
the line of boundary , then , from the source of the st. croix to the st. lawrence , so far as maine and massachusetts are concerned , is fixed by their own consent and for considerations satisfactory to them , the chief of these considerations being the privilege of transporting the lumber and agricultural products grown and raised in maine on the waters of the st. johns and its tributaries down that river to the ocean free from imposition or disability .
the importance of this privilege , perpetual in its terms , to a country covered at present by pine forests of great value , and much of it capable hereafter of agricultural improvement , is not a matter upon which the opinion of intelligent men is likely to be divided .
so far as new hampshire is concerned , the treaty secures all that she requires , and new york and vermont are quieted to the extent of their claim and occupation .
the difference which would be made in the northern boundary of these two states by correcting the parallel of latitude may be seen on tanner 's maps ( 1836 ) , new atlas , maps nos .
6 and 9 .
from the intersection of the forty - fifth degree of north latitude with the st. lawrence and along that river and the lakes to the water communication between lake huron and lake superior the line was definitively agreed on by the commissioners of the two governments under the sixth article of the treaty of ghent ; but between this last - mentioned point and the lake of the woods the commissioners acting under the seventh article of that treaty found several matters of disagreement , and therefore made no joint report to their respective governments .
the first of these was sugar island , or st. georges island , lying in st. marys river , or the water communication between lakes huron and superior .
by the present treaty this island is embraced in the territories of the united states .
both from soil and position it is regarded as of much value .
another matter of difference was the manner of extending the line from the point at which the commissioners arrived , north of isle royale , in lake superior , to the lake of the woods .
the british commissioner insisted on proceeding to fond du lac , at the southwest angle of the lake , and thence by the river st. louis to the rainy lake .
the american commissioner supposed the true course to be to proceed by way of the dog river .
attempts were made to compromise this difference , but without success .
the details of these proceedings are found at length in the printed separate reports of the commissioners .
from the imperfect knowledge of this remote country at the date of the treaty of peace , some of the descriptions in that treaty do not harmonize with its natural features as now ascertained . "
long lake " is nowhere to be found under that name .
there is reason for supposing , however , that the sheet of water intended by that name is the estuary at the mouth of pigeon river .
the present treaty therefore adopts that estuary and river , and afterwards pursues the usual route across the height of land by the various portages and small lakes till the line reaches rainy lake , from which the commissioners agreed on the extension of it to its termination in the northwest angle of the lake of the woods .
the region of country on and near the shore of the lake between pigeon river on the north and fond du lac and the river st. louis on the south and west , considered valuable as a mineral region , is thus included within the united states .
it embraces a territory of 4,000,000 acres northward of the claim set up by the british commissioner under the treaty of ghent .
from the height of land at the head of pigeon river westerly to the rainy lake the country is understood to be of little value , being described by surveyors and marked on the map as a region of rock and water .
from the northwest angle of the lake of the woods , which is found to be in latitude 45&#1087;&#1111;&#1029 ; 23 ' 55 " north , existing treaties require the line to be run due south to its intersection with the forty - fifth parallel , and thence along that parallel to the rocky mountains .
after sundry informal communications with the british minister upon the subject of the claims of the two countries to territory west of the rocky mountains , so little probability was found to exist of coming to any agreement on that subject at present that it was not thought expedient to make it one of the subjects of formal negotiation to be entered upon between this government and the british minister as part of his duties under his special mission .
by the treaty of 1783 the line of division along the rivers and lakes from the place where the forty - fifth parallel of north latitude strikes the st. lawrence to the outlet of lake superior is invariably to be drawn through the middle of such waters , and not through the middle of their main channels .
such a line , if extended according to the literal terms of the treaty , would , it is obvious , occasionally intersect islands .
the manner in which the commissioners of the two governments dealt with this difficult subject may be seen in their reports .
but where the line thus following the middle of the river or water course did not meet with islands , yet it was liable sometimes to leave the only practicable navigable channel altogether on one side .
the treaty made no provision for the common use of the waters by the citizens and subjects of both countries .
it has happened , therefore , in a few instances that the use of the river in particular places would be greatly diminished to one party or the other if in fact there was not a choice in the use of channels and passages .
thus at the long sault , in the st. lawrence -- a dangerous passage , practicable only for boats -- the only safe run is between the long sault islands and barnharts island ( all which belong to the united states ) on one side and the american shore on the other .
on the other hand , by far the best passage for vessels of any depth of water from lake erie into the detroit river is between bois blanc , a british island , and the canadian shore .
so again , there are several channels or passages , of different degrees of facility and usefulness , between the several islands in the river st. clair at or near its entry into the lake of that name .
in these three cases the treaty provides that all the several passages and channels shall be free and open to the use of the citizens and subjects of both parties .
the treaty obligations subsisting between the two countries for the suppression of the african slave trade and the complaints made to this government within the last three or four years , many of them but too well founded , of the visitation , seizure , and detention of american vessels on that coast by british cruisers could not but form a delicate and highly important part of the negotiations which have now been held .
the early and prominent part which the government of the united states has taken for the abolition of this unlawful and inhuman traffic is well known .
by the tenth article of the treaty of ghent it is declared that the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice , and that both his majesty and the united states are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition ; and it is thereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object .
the government of the united states has by law declared the african slave trade piracy , and at its suggestion other nations have made similar enactments .
it has not been wanting in honest and zealous efforts , made in conformity with the wishes of the whole country , to accomplish the entire abolition of the traffic in slaves upon the african coast , but these efforts and those of other countries directed to the same end have proved to a considerable degree unsuccessful .
treaties are known to have been entered into some years ago between england and france by which the former power , which usually maintains a large naval force on the african station , was authorized to seize and bring in for adjudication vessels found engaged in the slave trade under the french flag .
it is known that in december last a treaty was signed in london by the representatives of england , france , russia , prussia , and austria having for its professed object a strong and united effort of the five powers to put an end to the traffic .
this treaty was not officially communicated to the government of the united states , but its provisions and stipulations are supposed to be accurately known to the public .
it is understood to be not yet ratified on the part of france .
no application or request has been made to this government to become party to this treaty , but the course it might take in regard to it has exalted no small degree of attention and discussion in europe , as the principle upon which it is founded and the stipulations which it contains have caused warm animadversions and great political excitement .
in my message at the commencement of the present session of congress i endeavored to state the principles which this government supports respecting the right of search and the immunity of flags .
desirous of maintaining those principles fully , at the same time that existing obligations should be fulfilled , i have thought it most consistent with the honor and dignity of the country that it should execute its own laws and perform its own obligations by its own means and its own power .
the examination or visitation of the merchant vessels of one nation by the cruisers of another for any purpose except those known and acknowledged by the law of nations , under whatever restraints or regulations it may take place , may lead to dangerous results .
it is far better by other means to supersede any supposed necessity or any motive for such examination or visit .
interference with a merchant vessel by an armed cruiser is always a delicate proceeding , apt to touch the point of national honor as well as to affect the interests of individuals .
it has been thought , therefore , expedient , not only in accordance with the stipulations of the treaty of ghent , but at the same time as removing all pretext on the part of others for violating the immunities of the american flag upon the seas , as they exist and are defined by the law of nations , to enter into the articles now submitted to the senate .
the treaty which i now submit to you proposes no alteration , mitigation , or , modification of the rules of the law of nations .
it provides simply that each of the two governments shall maintain on the coast of africa a sufficient squadron to enforce separately and respectively the laws , rights , and obligations of the two countries for the suppression of the slave trade .
another consideration of great importance has recommended this mode of fulfilling the duties and obligations of the country .
our commerce along the western coast of africa is extensive , and supposed to be increasing .
there is reason to think that in many cases those engaged in it have met with interruptions and annoyances caused by the jealousy and instigation of rivals engaged in the same trade .
many complaints on this subject have reached the government .
a respectable naval force on the coast is the natural resort and security against further occurrences of this kind .
the surrender to justice of persons who , having committed high crimes , seek an asylum in the territories of a neighboring nation would seem to be an act due to the cause of general justice and properly belonging to the present state of civilization and intercourse .
the british provinces of north america are separated from the states of the union by a line of several thousand miles , and along portions of this line the amount of population on either side is quite considerable , while the passage of the boundary is always easy .
offenders against the law on the one side transfer themselves to the other .
sometimes , with great difficulty , they are brought to justice , but very often they wholly escape .
a consciousness of immunity from the power of avoiding justice in this way instigates the unprincipled and reckless to the commission of offenses , and the peace and good neighborhood of the border are consequently often disturbed .
in the case of offenders fleeing from canada into the united states , the governors of states are often applied to for their surrender , and questions of a very embarrassing nature arise from these applications .
it has been thought highly important , therefore , to provide for the whole case by a proper treaty stipulation .
the article on the subject in the proposed treaty is carefully confined to such offenses as all mankind agree to regard as heinous and destructive of the security of life and property .
in this careful and specific enumeration of crimes the object has been to exclude all political offenses or criminal charges arising from wars or intestine commotions .
treason , misprision of treason , libels , desertion from military service , and other offenses of similar character are excluded .
and lest some unforeseen inconvenience or unexpected abuse should arise from the stipulation rendering its continuance in the opinion of one or both of the parties not longer desirable , it is left in the power of either to put an end to it at will .
the destruction of the steamboat caroline at schlosser four or five years ago occasioned no small degree of excitement at the time , and became the subject of correspondence between the two governments .
that correspondence , having been suspended for a considerable period , was renewed in the spring of the last year , but no satisfactory result having been arrived at , it was thought proper , though the occurrence had ceased to be fresh and recent , not to omit attention to it on the present occasion .
it has only been so far discussed in the correspondence now submitted as it was accomplished by a violation of the territory of the united states .
the letter of the british minister , while he attempts to justify that violation upon the ground of a pressing and overruling necessity , admitting , nevertheless , that even if justifiable an apology was due for it , and accompanying this acknowledgment with assurances of the sacred regard of his government for the inviolability of national territory , has seemed to me sufficient to warrant forbearance from any further remonstrance against what took place as an aggression on the soil and territory of the country .
on the subject of the interference of the british authorities in the west indies , a confident hope is entertained that the correspondence which has taken place , showing the grounds taken by this government and the engagements entered into by the british minister , will be found such as to satisfy the just expectation of the people of the united states .
the impressment of seamen from merchant vessels of this country by british cruisers , although not practiced in time of peace , and therefore not at present a productive cause of difference and irritation , has , nevertheless , hitherto been so prominent a topic of controversy and is so likely to bring on renewed contentions at the first breaking out of a european war that it has been thought the part of wisdom now to take it into serious and earnest consideration .
the letter from the secretary of state to the british minister explains the ground which the government has assumed and the principles which it means to uphold .
for the defense of these grounds and the maintenance of these principles the most perfect reliance is placed on the intelligence of the american people and on their firmness and patriotism in whatever touches the honor of the country or its great and essential interests .

( the following are inserted because they pertain to the treaty transmitted with the message of president tyler immediately preceding . )
department of state , washington , august 3 , 1848 .
to the senate of the united states : 
 the secretary of state has the honor to transmit to the senate , in compliance with a resolution adopted by it on the 29th ultimo , a copy of the joint report of the commissioners under the treaty of washington of august 9 , 1842 , together with a copy of the report of the american commissioner transmitting the same to the state department .
james buchanan .
mr. smith to mr. buchanan .
washington , april 20 , 1848 .
sir : in presenting to you the joint report of the commissioners appointed under the treaty of washington of august 9 , 1842 , to survey and mark the line of boundary between the united states and the british provinces , which i have the honor herewith most respectfully to submit , i have to perform the painful duty of informing you that the maps of that line and of the adjacent country , which had been elaborately constructed by the scientific corps on the part of the united states , and contained upon 100 sheets of drawing paper of the largest size , together with the tables of the survey , have been destroyed by the conflagration of the building in which they were contained .
this house had been occupied by major james d. graham , the head of the scientific corps and principal astronomer of the american commission , as his office until his departure for mexico .
all the maps , drawings , and tables had been completed and duly authenticated by the joint commissioners , and were ready to be deposited with their joint report under their hands and seals in the archives of this government .
of this i had the honor to inform you in my letter of the 24th ultimo .
i can hardly express the pain which this unfortunate event has occasioned me .
but i can not perceive that any imputation of blame can properly be attached to any officer of the commission .
the care and custody of all the work of the united states scientific corps were properly placed in charge of major graham , as the head of that corps , who had had the immediate direction and superintendence of it from the first organization of the commission .
he required the maps and tables at his office for reference and revision in the progress of the astronomical work .
upon his departure for mexico he placed lieutenant a. w. whipple in his rooms with an injunction to guard with the utmost care the valuable property of the commission .
on the day after he left the city , and when for the first time informed of the fact , i called upon lieutenant whipple and requested him to have all the maps , drawings , and tables ready to be turned over to the state department on the following day .
on the 24th ultimo i acquainted you with that fact .
no censure can possibly be attributed to lieutenant whipple , whose great care and attention to all his duties have been on all occasions highly distinguished .
he escaped from the fire with scarcely an article of his dress , and his loss in money and clothing is at least $ 1,000 .
major graham has lost his valuable library , together with personal effects to a large amount .
the fire was communicated from the basement of the house , and by no effort could anything be saved .
there are tracings of the maps upon " tissue paper , " without the topography , in the state of maine , but they are not signed by the commissioners .
the field books of the engineers were , fortunately , not in major graham 's office , and are preserved .
duplicates of the maps , duly authenticated , have been placed in the british archives at london , which , although they have not the topography of the country so fully laid down upon them as it was upon our own , represent with equal exactness the survey of the boundary itself .
should it be deemed expedient by this government to procure copies of them , access to those archives for that purpose would undoubtedly be permitted , and the object accomplished at small expense , and when completed these copies could be authenticated by the joint commissioners in accordance with the provisions of the treaty .
i have the honor to be , with great respect , your obedient and humble servant , 
 albert smith .
report of the joint commission of boundary appointed under the treaty of washington of august 9 , 1842 .
the undersigned , commissioners appointed under the treaty of washington to trace and mark the boundary , as directed by that treaty , between the british possessions in north america and the united states -- that is to say , james buckhall estcourt , lieutenant - colonel in the british army , appointed commissioner by her britannic majesty , and albert smith , appointed commissioner by the president of the united states -- having accomplished the duty assigned to them , do now , in accordance with the directions of the said treaty , submit the following report and the accompanying maps , jointly signed , to their respective governments .
in obedience to the terms of the treaty , the undersigned met at bangor , in the state of maine , on the 1st day of may , 1843 , where they produced and verified the authority under which they each were respectively to act .
they then adjourned , because the weather was not sufficiently open for taking the field , to the 1st of the following month ( june ) , and agreed to meet again at that time at houlton .
accordingly , they did meet at that place , and began their operations .
it may be desirable to state at the outset that for the sake of convenience the whole line of boundary marked by the undersigned has been divided in the mention made of the different portions into the following grand divisions , viz : 
 " north line , " from the source of the st. croix to the intersection of the st. john .
" river st. john , " from the intersection of the north line to the mouth of the st. francis .
" river st. francis , " from its mouth to the outlet of lake pohenagamook .
" southwest line , " from the outlet of lake pohenagamook to the northwest branch of the st. john .
" south line , " from the northwest branch to the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 ' on the southwest branch .
" southwest branch , " from the parallel 46&#1087;&#1111;&#1029 ; 25 ' to its source .
" highlands , " from the source of the southwest branch of the st. john to the source of halls stream .
" halls streams " from its source to the intersection of the line of valentine and collins .
" west line , " from halls stream to the st. lawrence near st. regis , along the line of valentine and collins .
to return to the narration of operations : 
 the exploring line of colonel bouchette and mr. johnson , as directed by the treaty , was traced from the monument at the source of the st. croix to the intersection of the st. john .
the monument found at the source of the st. croix , as described in the report of colonel bouchette and mr. johnson , and the course of their exploring line , was traced by blazes or marks upon the trees .
an old line , cut out by the assistant surveyors of colonel bouchette and mr. johnson , was also found , which terminated about half a mile north of the south branch of the meduxnikeag , where , by records to which the undersigned referred , they ascertained that it had been abandoned because of its deviation from the exploring fine of colonel bouchette and mr. johnson .
after the exploration and remarking of the north line it was cut out 30 feet wide .
the same was afterwards done in all parts where the boundary passed through woodland .
after thus opening the north line it was surveyed , and iron posts were erected at intervals to mark it .
the general bearing of the line was rather to the west of the meridian of the monument at the source of the st. croix .
the precise line laid down by the undersigned was determined by successive courses , of which each was made to be as long as was convenient , provided it did not pass out of the opening of 30 feet .
at each angle of deflection an iron monument was erected , and placed anglewise with the line .
other monuments were erected at the crossing of roads , rivers , and at every mile , commencing from the source of the st. croix .
those which were not intended to mark angles of deflection were placed square with the line .
at the intersection of the st. john by the north line the river is deep and broad .
the boundary rims up the middle of the channel of the river , as indicated by the maps , dividing the islands as follows :

the islands were distributed to great britain or to the united states , as they were found to be on the fight or left of the deep channel .
there was but one doubtful case , la septieme isle , and that was apportioned to the united states because the majority of the owners were ascertained to reside on the united states side of the river .
monuments were erected upon the islands , marking them for great britain or the united states , as the case may have been .
after leaving the st. john the boundary enters the st. francis , dividing the islands at the mouth of that river in the manner shown in the maps .
it then runs up the st. francis , through the middle of the lakes upon it , to the outlet of lake pohenagamook , the third large lake from the mouth of the river .
at the outlet a large monument has been erected .
in order to determine the point on the northwest branch to which the treaty directed that a straight line should be run from the outlet of lake pohenagamook , a survey of that stream was made , and also of the main st. john in the neighborhood of the mouth of the northwest branch , and a line was cut between the john and the point on the northwest branch ascertained by the survey to be miles in the nearest direction from it , and the distance was afterwards verified by chaining .
it was ascertained also , in accordance with the provisions of the treaty , by a triangulation of the country toward the highlands dividing the waters of the st. lawrence and of the st. john , that more than 7 miles intervened between the point selected on the northwest branch and the crest of the dividing ridge .
a large iron monument was afterwards erected on the point thus selected , and the space around was cleared and sown with grass seed .
it is a short distance below the outlet of lake ishaganalshegeck .
the outlet of lake pohenagamook and the point on the northwest branch designated by the treaty having been thus ascertained and marked , in the spring of 1844 a straight line was run between them .
along that line , which passes entirely through forest , monuments were erected at every mile , at the crossings of the principal streams and rivers , and at the tops of those hills where a transit instrument had been set up to test the straightness of the line .
as soon as the parallel of latitude 46&#1087;&#1111;&#1029 ; 25 ' had been determined on the southwest branch , in the early part of the summer of 1844 , a straight line was drawn from the boundary point on the northwest branch to a large monument erected on the left bank of the southwest branch where it is intersected by the parallel of latitude 46&#1087;&#1111;&#1029 ; 25 : the line so drawn crosses the southwest branch once before it reaches the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 ' , and at about half a mile distance from that parallel .
there also a large monument has been set up on the left bank .
from the intersection of the parallel 46&#1087;&#1111;&#1029 ; 25 ' the boundary ascends the southwest branch , passes through a lake near its head , and so up a small stream which falls into the lake from the west to the source of that stream , which has been selected as the source of the southwest branch .
on the southwest branch there are two principal forks , at each of which two monuments have been erected , one on each bank of the river immediately above the forks and upon the branch established as the boundary .
the maps point out their positions .
at the mouth of the small stream selected as the source of the southwest branch a monument has been erected upon a delta formed by two small outlets .
above those outlets three other monuments have been placed at intervals upon the same stream .
upon the crest of the dividing ridge , very close to the source of the southwest branch , a large monument has been erected .
it is the first point in the highlands , and from it the boundary runs along the crest in a southerly direction , passing near to the southeastern shore of the portage lake , and so on to a large monument erected on a small eminence on the east side of the kennebec road .
thence it passes through a dwelling house called tachereau 's , which was standing there at the time the line was run ; so , by a tortuous course , it runs to the top of sandy stream mountain ; thence , inclining to the southwest , it runs over hog back the first , as shown in the maps ; thence toward hog back the second , which it leaves on the north side .
further on , at the head of leech lake , there is a stream which divides its waters and flows both into canada and into the united states .
the boundary has been made to run up that stream a short distance from the fork where the waters divide to a second fork ; thence between the streams which unite to form that fork , and then to ascend again the dividing ridge .
a monument has been erected at the fork first mentioned , where the waters divide .
as the boundary approaches the valley of spider river it bends to the southeast , and , by a wide circuit over high and steep hills , it turns the head of spider river ; thence it bends to the northwest until it approaches within about 4 miles of lake megantic ; thence it turns again south , having the valley of arnolds river on the right and of dead river on the left .
it leaves gasford mountain in canada , threads its way over very high ground between the head of arnolds river and the tributaries of the magalloway ; inclines then to the north , so to the west , over very rocky , mountainous , and difficult country , leaving gipps peak in the united states , and turns by a sharp angle at saddle back to the south .
after that it again inclines to the west , and then to the south , and again to the west , and passes the head of the connecticut .
about 3 miles and a half east of the head of the connecticut there is a division of waters similar to that described near leech lake .
the boundary runs down a stream from near its source to the fork where it divides , and then again follows the dividing ridge .
the spot is noted on the map .
after the boundary has passed the head of the connecticut it runs to the northwest , descending into very low , swampy ground between the heads of indian stream and the tributaries of the st. francis .
thus it passes on , bending again to the south of west , over a high hill , to the source of halls stream .
iron monuments have been erected at intervals along the highlands from the source of the southwest branch of the st. john to the source of halls stream , the position of each of which is shown upon the maps .
from the source of halls stream the boundary descends that river , dividing the islands , which are , however , merely unimportant alluvial deposits , in the manner indicated by the maps until it reaches the intersection of that stream by the line formerly run by valentine and collins as the forty - fifth degree of north latitude .
at that point a large monument has been erected on the right and a small one on the left bank of the stream .
monuments have also been erected along the bank of this stream , as indicated on the maps .
the line of valentine and collins was explored and found by the blazes still remaining in the original forest .
upon cutting into those blazes it was seen that deep seated in the tree there was a scar , the surface of the original blaze , slightly decayed , and upon counting the rings ( which indicate each year 's growth of the tree ) it was found that the blazes dated back to 1772 , 1773 , and 1774 .
the line of valentine and collins was run in 1771 , 1772 , 1773 , and 1774 .
the coincidence of the dates of the blazes with those of the above line , confirmed by the testimony of the people of the country , satisfied the undersigned that the line they had found was that mentioned in the treaty .
along this portion of the boundary , which is known as the forty - fifth degree of valentine and collins , and which extends from halls stream to st. regis , there are several interruptions to the blazes in those parts where clearings have been made , and there the authentic marks of the precise situation of the old line have been lost .
in those cases the undersigned have drawn the boundary line straight from the original blazes on the one side of a clearing to the original blazes on the other side of the same clearing .
it can not be positively stated that the line as it has been traced through those clearings precisely coincides with the old line , but the undersigned believe that it does not differ materially from it ; nor have they had the means of determining a nearer or a surer approximation .
along this line , at every point of deflection , an iron monument has been erected ; also at the crossing of rivers , lakes , and roads .
those which mark deflections are placed , as on the " north line , " anglewise with the line ; all the others are placed square with it .
the maps show the position of each .
on the eastern shore of lake memphremagog an astronomical station was established , and on a large flat rock of granite , which happened to lie between the astronomical station and the boundary , was cut the following inscription : 
 capt : robinson .
ast : station 
 422 feet north .
british boundary meridian line .
commission 
 boundary line 
 595 feet south 
 august , 1845 .
a mark was cut upon the stone , as indicated by the dot upon the meridian line above , from which these measurements were made .
at rouses point a monument of wrought stone was set up at the intersection of the boundary by the meridian of the transit instrument used there by major graham , and an inscription was cut upon it stating the latitude and longitude , the names of the observer and his assistant , the names of the commissioners , and the territories divided .
to mark the position of the instruments used at the following astronomical stations along the west line , two monuments within a few feet of each other have been erected at each station , and they have been placed on the boundary line due north or south of the instrument , as the case may have been .
the stations are : lake memphremagog , richford , john mccoy 's , trout river .
the boundary along the west line , though very far from being a straight line , is generally about half a mile north of the true parallel of latitude 45&#1087;&#1111;&#1029 ; from halls stream to rouses point .
at about 28 miles west of rouses point it , however , crosses that parallel to the south until it reaches chateaugay river , where it bends northward , and , crossing the parallel again about 4 miles east of st. regis , it strikes the st. lawrence 151 feet north of 45&#1087;&#1111;&#1029;. at that point a large monument has been erected on the bank of the st. lawrence .
two large monuments have also been erected , one on either side of the river richelieu near rouses point .
no marks of the old line were to be found about st. regis .
it was therefore agreed to run a line due west from the last blaze which should be found in the woods on the east side of st. regis .
that blaze occurred about 1 mile east of the st. regis river .
the maps , which exhibit the boundary on a scale of 4 inches to 1 statute mile , consist of 62 consecutive sheets of antiquarian paper as constructed by the british and of 61 as constructed by the american commission .
a general map has also been constructed on a scale of 8 miles to 1 inch by the british and of 10 miles to 1 inch by the american commission , upon which the before - mentioned sheets are represented .
the following portions of the boundary have been laid down by the british commission , on detached maps , on a scale of 12 inches to 1 mile , which have been signed by both commissioners : 
 grand falls of the st. john , including the intersection of that river by the north line ; islands of the st. john ; the outlet of lake pohenagamook ; the turning point of the boundary on the northwest branch of the st. john ; the intersection of the southwest branch by the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 ' ; the source of the southwest branch ; the source of halls stream ; the intersection of halls stream by the west line ; rouses point ; st. regis ; derby .
but similar maps have not been prepared by the american commission , because during the interval between the finishing of the maps of the british commission and those of the american it was thought that the maps already constructed upon a scale of 4 inches to 1 mile represented the boundary with sufficient clearness and accuracy .
the astronomical observations were begun at the grand falls early in june , 1843 , and were carried up the st. john river to the northwest branch by a chain of stations , which , together with the results obtained , are tabulated in the appendix accompanying this report .
from the valley of the st. john an astronomical connection was made with quebec , and thence to montreal , and so to rouses point .
from rouses point a connection was obtained with cambridge university , near boston .
the astronomical stations on the west line were : intersection of halls stream by the west line , lake memphremagog , richford , rouses point , john mccoy 's , trout river , st. regis .
latitude was also obtained at an astronomical station established for the purpose at the head of the connecticut .
volumes containing the astronomical observations of both commissions are herewith submitted .
from them it will be observed that the results for absolute longitude obtained by the british and american astronomers do not agree .
it being a difference in no way affecting the survey of the boundary line , the undersigned do not feel called upon to attempt to reconcile it .
the data upon which those results are based may be seen in the volumes of observations accompanying this report .
in the appendix will be found , in a tabular form , the following : 
 an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the north line ; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the southwest line ; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the south line ; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the highlands ; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the west line ; the position of the monuments erected on the southwest branch of the st. john and on halls stream ; the distribution of the islands of the st. john and the monuments on them ; the guide lines and offsets run by each commission for the survey of the highlands ; the azimuths of verification for the survey of the highlands ; the latitudes and longitudes obtained from the astronomical observations ; the comparative 1ongitudes obtained , and the methods used for the purpose .
upon comparing the maps of the two commissions it will be seen that the american commission numbers two monuments more than the british .
those are to be found , one on the " fourth island , " in the river st. john , and the other on the highlands between the source of the southwest branch of the river st. john and the kennebec road .
on the maps of the british commission representing the " west line " the name of the town of " derby " has been improperly placed north of the line instead of south of it .
also , on the same maps the direction of salmon river , near the western extremity of the " west line , " has been incorrectly laid down from the boundary line northward .
a direction has been given to it northeasterly instead of northwesterly .
the above two corrections the british commissioner is authorized to make on his maps after his return to england .
to avoid unnecessary delay in making their joint report , the undersigned have attached their signatures to the maps , although the lettering of some of the astronomical stations upon the maps of the american commission , as well as the alterations before mentioned in the maps of the british commission , are yet to be made ; but in the maps of both the boundary has been laid down accurately and definitively , and the undersigned engage that it shall not be altered in any respect .
in conclusion the undersigned have the honor to report that the line of boundary described in the foregoing statement has been run , marked , and surveyed , and the accompanying maps faithfully constructed from that survey .
the undersigned take leave to add that the most perfect harmony has subsisted between the two commissions from first to last , and that no differences have arisen between the undersigned in the execution of the duties intrusted to them .

to the people of the united states 
 fellow - citizens : before my arrival at the seat of government the painful communication was made to you by the officers presiding over the several departments of the deeply regretted death of william henry harrison , late president of the united states .
upon him you had conferred your suffrages for the first office in your gift , and had selected him as your chosen instrument to correct and reform all such errors and abuses as had manifested themselves from time to time in the practical operation of the government .
while standing at the threshold of this great work he has by the dispensation of an all - wise providence been removed from amongst us , and by the provisions of the constitution the efforts to be directed to the accomplishing of this vitally important task have devolved upon myself .
this same occurrence has subjected the wisdom and sufficiency of our institutions to a new test .
for the first time in our history the person elected to the vice - presidency of the united states , by the happening of a contingency provided for in the constitution , has had devolved upon him the presidential office .
the spirit of faction , which is directly opposed to the spirit of a lofty patriotism , may find in this occasion for assaults upon my administration ; and in succeeding , under circumstances so sudden and unexpected and to responsibilities so greatly augmented , to the administration of public affairs i shall place in the intelligence and patriotism of the people my only sure reliance .
my earnest prayer shall be constantly addressed to the all - wise and all - powerful being who made me , and by whose dispensation i am called to the high office of president of this confederacy , understandingly to carry out the principles of that constitution which i have sworn " to protect , preserve , and defend . "
the usual opportunity which is afforded to a chief magistrate upon his induction to office of presenting to his countrymen an exposition of the policy which would guide his administration , in the form of an inaugural address , not having , under the peculiar circumstances which have brought me to the discharge of the high duties of president of the united states , been afforded to me , a brief exposition of the principles which will govern me in the general course of my administration of public affairs would seem to be due as well to myself as to you .
in regard to foreign nations , the groundwork of my policy will be justice on our part to all , submitting to injustice from none .
while i shall sedulously cultivate the relations of peace and amity with one and all , it will be my most imperative duty to see that the honor of the country shall sustain no blemish .
with a view to this , the condition of our military defenses will become a matter of anxious solicitude .
the army , which has in other days covered itself with renown , and the navy , not inappropriately termed the right arm of the public defense , which has spread a light of glory over the american standard in all the waters of the earth , should be rendered replete with efficiency .
in view of the fact , well avouched by history , that the tendency of all human institutions is to concentrate power in the hands of a single man , and that their ultimate downfall has proceeded from this cause , i deem it of the most essential importance that a complete separation should take place between the sword and the purse .
no matter where or how the public moneys shall be deposited , so long as the president can exert the power of appointing and removing at his pleasure the agents selected for their custody the commander in chief of the army and navy is in fact the treasurer .
a permanent and radical change should therefore be decreed .
the patronage incident to the presidential office , already great , is constantly increasing .
such increase is destined to keep pace with the growth of our population , until , without a figure of speech , an army of officeholders may be spread over the land .
the unrestrained power exerted by a selfishly ambitious man in order either to perpetuate his authority or to hand it over to some favorite as his successor may lead to the employment of all the means within his control to accomplish his object .
the right to remove from office , while subjected to no just restraint , is inevitably destined to produce a spirit of crouching servility with the official corps , which , in order to uphold the hand which feeds them , would lead to direct and active interference in the elections , both state and federal , thereby subjecting the course of state legislation to the dictation of the chief executive officer and making the will of that officer absolute and supreme .
i will at a proper time invoke the action of congress upon this subject , and shall readily acquiesce in the adoption of all proper measures which are calculated to arrest these evils , so full of danger in their tendency .
i will remove no incumbent from office who has faithfully and honestly acquitted himself of the duties of his office , except in such cases where such officer has been guilty of an active partisanship or by secret means -- the less manly , and therefore the more objectionable has given his official influence to the purposes of party , thereby bringing the patronage of the government in conflict with the freedom of elections .
numerous removals may become necessary under this rule .
these will be made by me through no acerbity of feeling -- i have had no cause to cherish or indulge unkind feelings toward any -- but my conduct will be regulated by a profound sense of what is due to the country and its institutions ; nor shall i neglect to apply the same unbending rule to those of my own appointment .
freedom of opinion will be tolerated , the full enjoyment of the right of suffrage will be maintained as the birthright of every american citizen ; but i say emphatically to the official corps , " thus far and no farther . "
i have dwelt the longer upon this subject because removals from office are likely often to arise , and i would have my countrymen to understand the principle of the executive action .
in all public expenditures the most rigid economy should be resorted to , and , as one of its results , a public debt in time of peace be sedulously avoided .
a wise and patriotic constituency will never object to the imposition of necessary burdens for useful ends , and true wisdom dictates the resort to such means in order to supply deficiencies in the revenue , rather than to those doubtful expedients which , ultimating in a public debt , serve to embarrass the resources of the country and to lessen its ability to meet any great emergency which may arise .
all sinecures should be abolished .
the appropriations should be direct and explicit , so as to leave as limited a share of discretion to the disbursing agents as may be found compatible with the public service .
a strict responsibility on the part of all the agents of the government should be maintained and peculation or defalcation visited with immediate expulsion from office and the most condign punishment .
the public interest also demands that if any war has existed between the government and the currency it shall cease .
measures of a financial character now having the sanction of legal enactment shall be faithfully enforced until repealed by the legislative authority .
but i owe it to myself to declare that i regard existing enactments as unwise and impolitic and in a high degree oppressive .
i shall promptly give my sanction to any constitutional measure which , originating in congress , shall have for its object the restoration of a sound circulating medium , so essentially necessary to give confidence in all the transactions of life , to secure to industry its just and adequate rewards , and to reestablish the public prosperity .
in deciding upon the adaptation of any such measure to the end proposed , as well as its conformity to the constitution , i shall resort to the fathers of the great republican school for advice and instruction , to be drawn from their sage views of our system of government and the light of their ever - glorious example .
the institutions under which we live , my countrymen , secure each person in the perfect enjoyment of all his rights .
the spectacle is exhibited to the world of a government deriving its powers from the consent of the governed and having imparted to it only so much power as is necessary for its successful operation .
those who are charged with its administration should carefully abstain from all attempts to enlarge the range of powers thus granted to the several departments of the government other than by an appeal to the people for additional grants , lest by so doing they disturb that balance which the patriots and statesmen who framed the constitution designed to establish between the federal government and the states composing the union .
the observance of these rules is enjoined upon us by that feeling of reverence and affection which finds a place in the heart of every patriot for the preservation of union and the blessings of union -- for the good of our children and our children 's children through countless generations .
an opposite course could not fail to generate factions intent upon the gratification of their selfish ends , to give birth to local and sectional jealousies , and to ultimate either in breaking asunder the bonds of union or in building up a central system which would inevitably end in a bloody scepter and an iron crown .
in conclusion i beg you to be assured that i shall exert myself to carry the foregoing principles into practice during my administration of the government , and , confiding in the protecting care of an everwatchful and overruling providence , it shall be my first and highest duty to preserve unimpaired the free institutions under which we live and transmit them to those who shall succeed me in their full force and vigor .

to the senate and house of representatives : 
 i transmit herewith copies of dispatches received from our minister at mexico since the commencement of your present session , which claim from their importance , and i doubt not will receive , your calm and deliberate consideration .
the extraordinary and highly offensive language which the mexican government has thought proper to employ in reply to the remonstrance of the executive , through mr. shannon , against the renewal of the war with texas while the question of annexation was pending before congress and the people , and also the proposed manner of conducting that war , will not fail to arrest your attention .
such remonstrance , urged in no unfriendly spirit to mexico , was called for by considerations of an imperative character , having relation as well to the peace of this country and honor of this government as to the cause of humanity and civilization .
texas had entered into the treaty of annexation upon the invitation of the executive , and when for that act she was threatened with a renewal of the war on the part of mexico she naturally looked to this government to interpose its efforts to ward off the threatened blow .
but one course was left the executive , acting within the limits of its constitutional competency , and that was to pro , test in respectful , but at the same time strong and decided , terms against it .
the war thus threatened to be renewed was promulgated by edicts and decrees , which ordered on the part of the mexican military the desolation of whole tracts of country and the destruction without discrimination of all ages , sexes , and conditions of existence .
over the manner of conducting war mexico possesses no exclusive control .
she has no right to violate at pleasure the principles which an enlightened civilization has laid down for the conduct of nations at war , and thereby retrograde to a period of barbarism , which happily for the world has long since passed away .
all nations are interested in enforcing an observance of those principles , and the united states , the oldest of the american republics and the nearest of the civilized powers to the theater on which these enormities were proposed to be enacted , could not quietly content themselves to witness such a state of things .
they had through the executive on another occasion , and , as was believed , with the approbation of the whole country , remonstrated against outrages similar but even less inhuman than those which by her new edicts and decrees she has threatened to perpetrate , and of which the late inhuman massacre at tabasco was but the precursor .
the bloody and inhuman murder of fannin and his companions , equaled only in savage barbarity by the usages of the untutored indian tribes , proved how little confidence could be placed on the most solemn stipulations of her generals , while the fate of others who became her captives in war -- many of whom , no longer able to sustain the fatigues and privations of long journeys , were shot down by the wayside , while their companions who survived were subjected to sufferings even more painful than death -- had left an indelible stain on the page of civilization .
the executive , with the evidence of an intention on the part of mexico to renew scenes so revolting to humanity , could do no less than renew remonstrances formerly urged .
for fulfilling duties so imperative mexico has thought proper , through her accredited organs , because she has had represented to her the inhumanity of such proceedings , to indulge in language unknown to the courtesy of diplomatic intercourse and offensive in the highest degree to this government and people .
nor has she offended in this only .
she has not only violated existing conventions between the two countries by arbitrary and unjust decrees against our trade and intercourse , but withholds installments of debt due to our citizens which she solemnly pledged herself to pay under circumstances which are fully explained by the accompanying letter from mr. green , our secretary of legation .
and when our minister has invited the attention of her government to wrongs committed by her local authorities , not only on the property but on the persons of our fellow - citizens engaged in prosecuting fair and honest pursuits , she has added insult to injury by not even deigning for months together to return an answer to his representations .
still further to manifest her unfriendly feelings toward the united states , she has issued decrees expelling from some of her provinces american citizens engaged in the peaceful pursuits of life , and now denies to those of our citizens prosecuting the whale fishery on the northwest coast of the pacific the privilege , which has through all time heretofore been accorded to them , of exchanging goods of a small amount in value at her ports in california for supplies indispensable to their health and comfort .
nor will it escape the observation of congress that in conducting a correspondence with a minister of the united states , who can not and does not know any distinction between the geographical sections of the union , charges wholly unfounded are made against particular states , and an appeal to others for aid and protection against supposed wrongs .
in this same connection , sectional prejudices are attempted to be excited and the hazardous and unpardonable effort is made to foment divisions amongst the states of the union and thereby imbitter their peace .
mexico has still to learn that however freely we may indulge in discussion among ourselves , the american people will tolerate no interference in their domestic affairs by any foreign government , and in all that concerns the constitutional guaranties and the national honor the people of the united states have but one mind and one heart .
the subject of annexation addresses itself , most fortunately , to every portion of the union .
the executive would have been unmindful of its highest obligations if it could have adopted a course of policy dictated by sectional interests and local feelings .
on the contrary , it was because the question was neither local nor sectional , but made its appeal to the interests of the whole union , and of every state in the union , that the negotiation , and finally the treaty of annexation , was entered into ; and it has afforded me no ordinary pleasure to perceive that so far as demonstrations have been made upon it by the people they have proceeded from all portions of the union .
mexico may seek to excite divisions amongst us by uttering unjust denunciations against particular states , but when she comes to know that the invitations addressed to our fellow - citizens by spain , and afterwards by herself , to settle texas were accepted by emigrants from all the states , and when , in addition to this , she refreshes her recollection with the fact that the first effort which was made to acquire texas was during the administration of a distinguished citizen from an eastern state , which was afterwards renewed under the auspices of a president from the southwest , she will awake to a knowledge of the futility of her present purpose of sowing dissensions among us or producing distraction in our councils by attach either on particular states or on persons who are now in the retirement of private life .
considering the appeal which she now makes to eminent citizens by name , can she hope to escape censure for having ascribed to them , as well as to others , a design , as she pretends now for the first time revealed , of having originated negotiations to despoil her by duplicity and falsehood of a portion of her territory ?
the opinion then , as now , prevailed with the executive that the annexation of texas to the union was a matter of vast importance in order to acquire that territory before it had assumed a position among the independent powers of the earth , propositions were made to mexico for a cession of it to the united states .
mexico saw in these proceedings at the time no cause of complaint .
she is now , when simply reminded of them , awakened to the knowledge of the fact , which she , through her secretary of state , promulgates to the whole world as true , that those negotiations were founded in deception and falsehood and superinduced by unjust and iniquitous motives .
while texas was a dependency of mexico the united states opened negotiations with the latter power for the cession of her then acknowledged territory , and now that texas is independent of mexico and has maintained a separate existence for nine years , during which time she has been received into the family of nations and is represented by accredited ambassadors at many of the principal courts of europe , and when it has become obvious to the whole world that she is forever lost to mexico , the united states is charged with deception and falsehood in all relating to the past , and condemnatory accusations are made against states which have had no special agency in the matter , because the executive of the whole union has negotiated with free and independent texas upon a matter vitally important to the interests of both countries ; and after nine years of unavailing war mexico now announces her intention , through her secretary of foreign affairs , never to consent to the independence of texas or to abandon the effort to reconquer that republic .
she thus announces a perpetual claim , which at the end of a century will furnish her as plausible a ground for discontent against any nation which at the end of that time may enter into a treaty with texas as she possesses at this moment against the united states .
the lapse of time can add nothing to her title to independence .
a course of conduct such as has been described on the part of mexico , in violation of all friendly feeling and of the courtesy which should characterize the intercourse between the nations of the earth , might well justify the united states in a resort to any measures to vindicate their national honor ; but , actuated by a sincere desire to preserve the general peace , and in view of the present condition of mexico , the executive , resting upon its integrity , and not fearing but that the judgment of the world will duly appreciate its motives , abstains from recommending to congress a resort to measures of redress and contents itself with reurging upon that body prompt and immediate action on the subject of annexation .
by adopting that measure the united states will be in the exercise of an undoubted right ; and if mexico , not regarding their forbearance , shall aggravate the injustice of her conduct by a declaration of war against them , upon her head will rest all the responsibility .

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states : 
 i transmit herewith , for the information of congress , copies of certain dispatches recently received from mr. wise , our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at the court of brazil , upon the subject of the slave trade , developing the means used and the devices resorted to hi order to evade existing enactments upon that subject .
anxiously desirous as are the united states to suppress a traffic so revolting to humanity , in the efforts to accomplish which they have been the pioneers of civilized states , it can not but be a subject of the most profound regret that any portion of our citizens should be found acting in cooperation with the subjects of other powers in opposition to the policy of their own government , thereby subjecting to suspicion and to the hazard of disgrace the flag of their own country .
it is true that this traffic is carried on altogether in foreign parts and that our own coasts are free from its pollution ; but the crime remains the same wherever perpetrated , and there are many circumstances to warrant the belief that some of our citizens are deeply involved in its guilt .
the mode and manner of carrying on this trade are clearly and fearlessly set forth in the accompanying documents , and it would seem that a regular system has been adopted for the purpose of thwarting the policy and evading the penalties of our laws .
american vessels , with the knowledge , as there are good reasons to believe , of the owners and masters , are chartered , or rather purchased , by notorious slave dealers in brazil , aided by english brokers and capitalists , with this intent .
the vessel is only nominally chartered at so much per month , while in truth it is actually sold , to be delivered on the coast of africa ; the charter party binding the owners in the meantime to take on board as passengers a new crew in brazil , who , when delivered on the coast , are to navigate her back to the ports of brazil with her cargo of slaves .
under this agreement the vessel clears from the united states for some port in great britain , where a cargo of merchandise known as " coast goods , " and designed especially for the african trade , is purchased , shipped , and consigned , together with the vessel , either directly to the slave dealer himself or to his agents or accomplices in brazil .
on her arrival a new crew is put on board as passengers and the vessel and cargo consigned to an equally guilty factor or agent on the coast of africa , where the unlawful purpose originally designed is finally consummated .
the merchandise is exchanged for slaves , the vessel is delivered up , her name obliterated , her papers destroyed , her american crew discharged , to be provided for by the charters , and the new or passenger crew put in command to carry back its miserable freight to the first contrivers of the voyage , or their employees in brazil .
during the whole progress of this tortuous enterprise it is possible that neither the american crew originally enlisted nor the passenger crew put on board in the brazilian ports are aware of the nature of the voyage , and yet it is on these principally , ignorant if not innocent , that the penalties of the law are inflicted , while the guilty contrivers -- the charterers , brokers , owners , and masters ; in short , all who are most deeply concerned in the crime and its rewards -- for the most part escape unpunished .
it will be seen from the examinations which have recently taken place at rio that the subjects of her britannic majesty as well as our own citizens are deeply implicated in this inhuman traffic .
british factors and agents , while they supply africa with british fabrics in exchange for slaves , are chiefly instrumental in the abuse of the american flag ; and the suggestions contained in the letter of mr. wise ( whose judicious and zealous efforts in the matter can not be too highly commended ) , addressed to mr. hamilton , the british envoy , as to the best mode of suppressing the evil , deserve your most deliberate consideration , as they will receive , i doubt not , that of the british government .
it is also worthy of consideration whether any other measures than those now existing are necessary to give greater efficacy to the just and humane policy of our laws , which already provide for the restoration to africa of slaves captured at sea by american cruisers .
from time to time provision has been made by this government for their comfortable support and maintenance during a limited period after their restoration , and it is much to be regretted that this liberal policy has not been adopted by great britain .
as it is , it seems to me that the policy it has adopted is calculated rather to perpetuate than to suppress the trade by enlisting very large interests in its favor .
merchants and capitalists furnish the means of carrying it on ; manufactures , for which the negroes are exchanged , are the products of her workshops ; the slaves , when captured , instead of being returned back to their homes are transferred to her colonial possessions in the west indies and made the means of swelling the amount of their products by a system of apprenticeship for a term of years ; and the officers and crews who capture the vessels receive on the whole number of slaves so many pounds sterling per capita by way of bounty .
it must be obvious that while these large interests are enlisted in favor of its continuance it will be difficult , if not impossible , to suppress the nefarious traffic , and that its results would be in effect but a continuance of the slave trade in another and more cruel form ; for it can be but a matter of little difference to the african whether he is torn from his country and transported to the west indies as a slave in the regular course of the trade , or captured .by a cruiser , transferred to the same place , and made to perform the same labor under the name of an apprentice , which is at present the practical operation of the policy adopted .
it is to be hoped that her britannic majesty 's government will , upon a review of all the circumstances stated in these dispatches , adopt more efficient measures for the suppression of the trade , which she has so long attempted to put down , with , as yet , so little success , and more consonant with the original policy of restoring the captured african to his home .

to the senate of the united states : 
 the bill entitled " an act to incorporate the subscribers to the fiscal bank of the united states , " which originated in the senate , has been considered by me with a sincere desire to conform my action in regard to it to that of the two houses of congress .
by the constitution it is made my duty either to approve the bill by signing it or to return it with my objections to the house in which it originated .
i can not conscientiously give it my approval , and i proceed to discharge the duty required of me by the constitution -- to give my reasons for disapproving .
the power of congress to create a national bank to operate per se over the union has been a question of dispute from the origin of the government .
men most justly and deservedly esteemed for their high intellectual endowments , their virtue , and their patriotism have in regard to it entertained different and conflicting opinions ; congresses have differed ; the approval of one president has been followed by the disapproval of another ; the people at different times have acquiesced in decisions both for and against .
the country has been and still is deeply agitated by this unsettled question .
it will suffice for me to say that my own opinion has been uniformly proclaimed to be against the exercise of any such power by this government .
on all suitable occasions during a period of twenty - five years the opinion thus entertained has been unreservedly expressed .
i declared it in the legislature of my native state ; in the house of representatives of the united states it has been openly vindicated by me ; in the senate chamber , in the presence and hearing of many who are at this time members of that body , it has been affirmed and reaffirmed in speeches and reports there made and by votes there recorded ; in popular assemblies i have unhesitatingly announced it , and the last public declaration which i made -- and that but a short time before the late presidential election -- i referred to my previously expressed opinions as being those then entertained by me .
with a full knowledge of the opinions thus entertained and never concealed , i was elected by the people vice - president of the united states .
by the occurrence of a contingency provided for in the constitution and arising under an impressive dispensation of providence i succeeded to the presidential office .
before entering upon the duties of that office i took an oath that i would " preserve , protect , and defend the constitution of the united states . "
entertaining the opinions alluded to and having taken this oath , the senate and the country will see that i could not give my sanction to a measure of the character described without surrendering all claim to the respect of honorable men , all confidence on the part of the people , all self - respect , all regard for moral and religious obligations , without an observance of which no government can be prosperous and no people can be happy .
it would be to commit a crime which i would not willfully commit to gain any earthly reward , and which would justly subject me to the ridicule and scorn of all virtuous men .
i deem it entirely unnecessary at this time to enter upon the reasons which have brought my mind to the convictions i feel and entertain on this subject .
they have been over and over again repeated .
if some of those who have preceded me in this high office have entertained and avowed different opinions , i yield all confidence that their convictions were sincere .
i claim only to have the same measure meted out to myself .
without going further into the argument , i will say that in looking to the powers of this government to collect , safely keep , and disburse the public revenue , and incidentally to regulate the commerce and exchanges , i have not been able to satisfy myself that the establishment by this government of a bank of discount in the ordinary acceptation of that term was a necessary means or one demanded by propriety to execute those powers .
what can the local discounts of the bank have to do with the collecting , safe - keeping , and disbursing of the revenue ?
so far as the mere discounting of paper is concerned , it is quite immaterial to this question whether the discount is obtained at a state bank or a united states bank .
they are both equally local , both beginning and both ending in a local accommodation .
what influence have local discounts granted by any form of bank in the regulating of the currency and the exchanges ?
let the history of the late united states bank aid us in answering this inquiry .
for several years after the establishment of that institution it dealt almost exclusively in local discounts , and during that period the country was for the most part disappointed in the consequences anticipated from its incorporation .
a uniform currency was not provided , exchanges were not regulated , and little or nothing was added to the general circulation , and in 1920 its embarrassments had become so great that the directors petitioned congress to repeal that article of the charter which made its notes receivable everywhere in payment of the public dues .
it had up to that period dealt to but a very small extent in exchanges , either foreign or domestic , and as late as 1823 its operations in that line amounted to a little more than $ 7,000,000 per annum .
a very rapid augmentation soon after occurred , and in 1833 its dealings in the exchanges amounted to upward of $ 100,000,000 , including the sales of its own drafts ; and all these immense transactions were effected without the employment of extraordinary means .
the currency of the country became sound , and the negotiations in the exchanges were carried on at the lowest possible rates .
the circulation was increased to more than $ 22,000,000 and the notes of the bank were regarded as equal to specie all over the country , thus showing almost conclusively that it was the capacity to deal in exchanges , and not in local discounts , which furnished these facilities and advantages .
it may be remarked , too , that notwithstanding the immense transactions of the bank in the purchase of exchange , the losses sustained were merely nominal , while in the line of discounts the suspended debt was enormous and proved most disastrous to the bank and the country .
its power of local discount has in fact proved to be a fruitful source of favoritism and corruption , alike destructive to the public morals and to the general weal .
the capital invested in banks of discount in the united states , created by the states , at this time exceeds $ 350,000,000 , and if the discounting of local paper could have produced any beneficial effects the united states ought to possess the soundest currency in the world ; but the reverse is lamentably the fact .
is the measure now under consideration of the objectionable character to which i have alluded ?
it is clearly so unless by the sixteenth fundamental article of the eleventh section it is made otherwise .
that article is in the following words : 
 the directors of the said corporation shall establish one competent office of discount and deposit in any state in which two thousand shares shall have been subscribed or may be held , whenever , upon application of the legislature of such state , congress may by law require the same .
and the said directors may also establish one or more competent offices of discount and deposit in any territory or district of the united states , and in any state with the assent of such state , and when established the said office or offices shall be only withdrawn or removed by the said directors prior to the expiration of this charter with the previous assent of congress : provided , in respect to any state which shall not , at the first session of the legislature thereof held after the passage of this act , by resolution or other usual legislative proceeding , unconditionally assent or dissent to the establishment of such office or offices within it , such assent of the said state shall be thereafter presumed : and provided , nevertheless , that whenever it shall become necessary and proper for carrying into execution any of the powers granted by the constitution to establish an office or offices in any of the states whatever , and the establishment thereof shall be directed by law , it shall be the duty of the said directors to establish such office or offices accordingly .
it will be seen that by this clause the directors are invested with the fullest power to establish a branch in any state which has yielded its assent ; and having once established such branch , it shall not afterwards be withdrawn except by order of congress .
such assent is to be implied and to have the force and sanction of an actually expressed assent , " provided , in respect to any state which shall not , at the first session of the legislature thereof held after the passage of this act , by resolution or other usual legislative proceeding , unconditionally assent or dissent to the establishment of such office or offices within it , such assent of said state shall be thereafter presumed . "
the assent or dissent is to be expressed unconditionally at the first session of the legislature , by some formal legislative act ; and if not so expressed its assent is to be implied , and the directors are thereupon invested with power , at such time thereafter as they may please , to establish branches , which can not afterwards be withdrawn except by resolve of congress .
no matter what may be the cause which may operate with the legislature , which either prevents it from speaking or addresses itself to its wisdom , to induce delay , its assent is to be implied .
this iron rule is to give way to no circumstances ; it is unbending and inflexible .
it is the language of the master to the vassal ; an unconditional answer is claimed forthwith , and delay , postponement , or incapacity to answer produces an implied assent which is ever after irrevocable .
many of the state elections have already taken place without any knowledge on the part of the people that such a question was to come up .
the representatives may desire a submission of the question to their constituents preparatory to final action upon it , but this high privilege is denied ; whatever may be the motives and views entertained by the representatives of the people to induce delay , their assent is to be presumed , and is ever afterwards binding unless their dissent shall be unconditionally expressed at their first session after the passage of this bill into a law .
they may by formal resolution declare the question of assent or dissent to be undecided and postponed , and yet , in opposition to their express declaration to the contrary , their assent is to be implied .
cases innumerable might be cited to manifest the irrationality of such an inference .
let one or two in addition suffice .
the popular branch of the legislature may express its dissent by an unanimous vote , and its resolution may be defeated by a tie vote of the senate , and yet the assent is to be implied .
both branches of the legislature may concur in a resolution of decided dissent , and yet the governor may exert the veto power conferred on him by the state constitution , and their legislative action be defeated , and yet the assent of the legislative authority is implied , and the directors of this contemplated institution are authorized to establish a branch or branches in such state whenever they may find it conducive to the interest of the stockholders to do so ; and having once established it they can under no circumstances withdraw it except by act of congress .
the state may afterwards protest against such unjust inference , but its authority is gone .
its assent is implied by its failure or inability to act at its first session , and its voice can never afterwards be heard .
to inferences so violent and , as they seem to me , irrational i can not yield my consent .
no court of justice would or could sanction them without reversing all that is established in judicial proceeding by introducing presumptions at variance with fact and inferences at the expense of reason .
a state in a condition of duress would be presumed to speak as an individual manacled and in prison might be presumed to be in the enjoyment of freedom .
far better to say to the states boldly and frankly , congress wills and submission is demanded .
it may be said that the directors may not establish branches under such circumstances ; but this is a question of power , and this bill invests them with full authority to do so .
if the legislature of new york or pennsylvania or any other state should be found to be in such condition as i have supposed , could there be any security furnished against such a step on the part of the directors ?
nay , is it not fairly to be presumed that this proviso was introduced for the sole purpose of meeting the contingency referred to ?
why else should it have been introduced ?
and i submit to the senate whether it can be believed that any state would be likely to sit quietly down under such a state of things .
in a great measure of public interest their patriotism may be successfully appealed to , but to infer their assent from circumstances at war with such inference i can not but regard as calculated to excite a feeling at fatal enmity with the peace and harmony of the country .
i must therefore regard this clause as asserting the power to be in congress to establish offices of discount in a state not only without its assent , but against its dissent , and so regarding it i can not sanction it .
on general principles the right in congress to prescribe terms to any state implies a superiority of power and control , deprives the transaction of all pretense to compact between them , and terminates , as we have seen , in the total abrogation of freedom of action on the part of the states .
but , further , the state may express , after the most solemn form of legislation , its dissent , which may from time to time thereafter be repeated in full view of its own interest , which can never be separated from the wise and beneficent operation of this government , and yet congress may by virtue of the last proviso overrule its law , and upon grounds which to such state will appear to rest on a constructive necessity and propriety and nothing more .
i regard the bill as asserting for congress the right to incorporate a united states bank with power and right to establish offices of discount and deposit in the several states of this union with or without their consent -- a principle to which i have always heretofore been opposed and which can never obtain my sanction ; and waiving all other considerations growing out of its other provisions , i return it to the house in which it originated with these my objections to its approval .

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states .
fellow - citizens : you have been assembled in your respective halls of legislation under a proclamation bearing the signature of the illustrious citizen who was so lately called by the direct suffrages of the people to the discharge of the important functions of their chief executive office .
upon the expiration of a single month from the day of his installation he has paid the great debt of nature , leaving behind him a name associated with the recollection of numerous benefits conferred upon the country during a long life of patriotic devotion .
with this public bereavement are connected other considerations which will not escape the attention of congress .
the preparations necessary for his removal to the seat of government in view of a residence of four years must have devolved upon the late president heavy expenditures , which , if permitted to burthen the limited resources of his private fortune , may tend seriously to the embarrassment of his surviving family ; and it is therefore respectfully submitted to congress whether the ordinary principles of justice would not dictate the propriety of its legislative interposition .
by the provisions of the fundamental law the powers and duties of the high station to which he was elected have devolved upon me , and in the dispositions of the representatives of the states and of the people will be found , to a great extent , a solution of the problem to which our institutions are for the first time subjected .
in entering upon the duties of this office i did not feel that it would be becoming in me to disturb what had been ordered by my lamented predecessor .
whatever , therefore , may have been my opinion originally as to the propriety of convening congress at so early a day from that of its late adjournment , i found a new and controlling inducement not to interfere with the patriotic desires of the late president in the novelty of the situation in which i was so unexpectedly placed .
my first wish under such circumstances would necessarily have been to have called to my aid in the administration of public affairs the combined wisdom of the two houses of congress , in order to take their counsel and advice as to the best mode of extricating the government and the country from the embarrassments weighing heavily on both .
i am , then , most happy in finding myself so soon after my accession to the presidency surrounded by the immediate representatives of the states and people .
no important changes having taken place in our foreign relations since the last session of congress , it is not deemed necessary on this occasion to go into a detailed statement in regard to them .
i am happy to say that i see nothing to destroy the hope of being able to preserve peace .
the ratification of the treaty with portugal has been duly exchanged between the two governments .
this government has not been inattentive to the interests of those of our citizens who have claims on the government of spain rounded on express treaty stipulations , and a hope is indulged that the representations which have been made to that government on this subject may lead ere long to beneficial results .
a correspondence has taken place between the secretary of state and the minister of her britannic majesty accredited to this government on the subject of alexander mcleod 's indictment and imprisonment , copies of which are herewith communicated to congress .
in addition to what appears from these papers , it may be proper to state that alexander mcleod has been heard by the supreme court of the state of new york on his motion to be discharged from imprisonment , and that the decision of that court has not as yet been pronounced .
the secretary of state has addressed to me a paper upon two subjects interesting to the commerce of the country , which will receive my consideration , and which i have the honor to communicate to congress .
so far as it depends on the course of this government , our relations of good will and friendship will be sedulously cultivated with all nations .
the true american policy will be found to consist in the exercise of a spirit of justice , to be manifested in the discharge of all our international obligations to the weakest of the family of nations as well as to the most powerful .
occasional conflicts of opinion may arise , but when the discussions incident to them are conducted in the language of truth and with a strict regard to justice the scourge of war will for the most part be avoided .
the time ought to be regarded as having gone by when a resort to arms is to be esteemed as the only proper arbiter of national differences .
the census recently taken shows a regularly progressive increase in our population .
upon the breaking out of the war of the revolution our numbers scarcely equaled 3,000,000 souls ; they already exceed 17,000,000 , and will continue to progress in a ratio which duplicates in a period of about twenty - three years .
the old states contain a territory sufficient in itself to maintain a population of additional millions , and the most populous of the new states may even yet be regarded as but partially settled , while of the new lands on this side of the rocky mountains , to say nothing of the immense region which stretches from the base of those mountains to the mouth of the columbia river , about 770,000,000 acres , ceded and unceded , still remain to be brought into market .
we hold out to the people of other countries an invitation to come and settle among us as members of our rapidly growing family , and for the blessings which we offer them we require of them to look upon our country as their country and to unite with us in the great task of preserving our institutions and thereby perpetuating our liberties .
no motive exists for foreign conquest ; we desire but to reclaim our almost illimitable wildernesses and to introduce into their depths the lights of civilization .
while we shall at all times be prepared to vindicate the national honor , our most earnest desire will be to maintain an unbroken peace .
in presenting the foregoing views i can not withhold the expression of the opinion that there exists nothing in the extension of our empire over our acknowledged possessions to excite the alarm of the patriot for the safety of our institutions .
the federative system , leaving to each state the care of its domestic concerns and devolving on the federal government those of general import , admits in safety of the greatest expansion ; but at the same time i deem it proper to add that there will be found to exist at all times an imperious necessity for restraining all the functionaries of this government within the range of their respective powers , thereby preserving a just balance between the powers granted to this government and those reserved to the states and to the people .
from the report of the secretary of the treasury you will perceive that the fiscal means , present and accruing , are insufficient to supply the wants of the government for the current year .
the balance in the treasury on the 4th day of march last not covered by outstanding drafts , and exclusive of trust funds , is estimated at $ 860,000 .
this includes the sum of $ 215,000 deposited in the mint and its branches to procure metal for coining and in process of coinage , and which could not be withdrawn without inconvenience , thus leaving subject to draft in the various depositories the sum of $ 645,000 .
by virtue of two several acts of congress the secretary of the treasury was authorized to issue on and after the 4th day of march last treasury notes to the amount of $ 5,413,000 , making an aggregate available fund of $ 6,058,000 on hand .
but this fund was chargeable , with outstanding treasury notes redeemable in the current year and interest thereon , to the estimated amount of $ 5,280,000 .
there is also thrown upon the treasury the payment of a large amount of demands accrued in whole or in part in former years , which will exhaust the available means of the treasury and leave the accruing revenue , reduced as it is in amount , burthened with debt and charged with the current expenses of the government .
the aggregate amount of outstanding appropriations on the 4th day of march last was $ 33,429,616.50 , of which $ 24,210,000 will be required during the current year ; and there will also be required for the use of the war department additional appropriations to the amount of $ 2,511,132.98 , the special objects of which will be seen by reference to the report of the secretary of war .
the anticipated means of the treasury are greatly inadequate to this demand .
the receipts from customs for the last three quarters of the last year and first quarter of the present year amounted to $ 12,100,000 ; the receipts for lands for the same time to $ 2,742,450 , shewing an average revenue from both sources of $ 1,236,870 per month .
a gradual expansion of trade , growing out of a restoration of confidence , together with a reduction in the expenses of collecting and punctuality on the part of collecting officers , may cause an addition to the monthly receipts from the customs .
they are estimated for the residue of the year from the 4th of march at $ 12,000,000 .
the receipts from the public lands for the same time are estimated at $ 2,500,000 , and from miscellaneous sources at $ 12,000,000 , making an aggregate of available fund within the year of $ 15,315,000 which will leave a probable deficit of $ 11,406,132.98 .
to meet this some temporary provision is necessary until the amount can be absorbed by the excess of revenues which are anticipated to accrue at no distant day .
there will fall due within the next three months treasury notes of the issues of 1840 , including interest , about $ 2,850,000 there is chargeable in the same period for arrearages for taking the sixth census $ 294,000 , and the estimated expenditures for the current service are about $ 8,100,000 , making the aggregate demand upon the treasury prior to the 1st of september next about $ 11,340,000 .
the ways and means in the treasury and estimated to accrue within the above - named period consist of about $ 694,000 of funds available on the 28th ultimo , an unissued balance of treasury notes authorized by the act of 1841 amounting to $ 1,955,000 , and estimated receipts from all sources of $ 3,800,000 , making an aggregate of about $ 6,450,000 , and leaving a probable deficit on the 1st of september next of $ 4,845,000 .
in order to supply the wants of the government , an intelligent constituency , in view of their best interests , will without hesitation submit to all necessary burthens .
but it is nevertheless important so to impose them as to avoid defeating the just expectations of the country growing out of preexisting laws .
the act of the 2d of march , 1833 , commonly called the " compromise act , " should not be altered except under urgent necessities , which are not believed at this time to exist .
one year only remains to complete the series of reductions provided for by that law , at which time provisions made by the same law , and which then will be brought actively in aid of the manufacturing interests of the union , will not fail to produce the most beneficial results .
under a system of discriminating duties imposed for purposes of revenue , in unison with the provisions of existing laws , it is to be hoped that our policy will in the future be fixed and permanent , so as to avoid those constant fluctuations which defeat the very objects they have in view .
we shall thus best maintain a position which , while it will enable us the more readily to meet the advances of other countries calculated to promote our trade and commerce , will at the same time leave in our own hands the means of retaliating with greater effect unjust regulations .
in intimate connection with the question of revenue is that which makes provision for a suitable fiscal agent , capable of adding increased facilities in the collection and disbursement of the public revenues , rendering more secure their custody , and consulting a true economy in the great , multiplied , and delicate operations of the treasury department .
upon such an agent depends in an eminent degree the establishment of a currency of uniform value , which is of so great importance to all the essential interests of society , and on the wisdom to be manifested in its creation much depends .
so intimately interwoven are its operations , not only with the interests of individuals , but of states , that it may be regarded to a great degree as controlling both .
if paper be used as the chief medium of circulation , and the power be vested in the government of issuing it at pleasure , either in the form of treasury drafts or any other , or if banks be used as the public depositories , with liberty to regard all surpluses from day to day as so much added to their active capital , prices are exposed to constant fluctuations and industry to severe suffering .
in the one case political considerations directed to party purposes may control , while excessive cupidity may prevail in the other .
the public is thus constantly liable to imposition .
expansions and contractions may follow each other in rapid succession -- the one engendering a reckless spirit of adventure and speculation , which embraces states as well as individuals , the other causing a fall in prices and accomplishing an entire change in the aspect of affairs .
stocks of all sorts rapidly decline , individuals are ruined , and states embarrassed even in their efforts to meet with punctuality the interest on their debts .
such , unhappily , is the condition of things now existing in the united states .
these effects may readily be traced to the causes above referred to .
the public revenues , being removed from the then bank of the united states , under an order of a late president , were placed in selected state banks , which , actuated by the double motive of conciliating the government and augmenting their profits to the greatest possible extent , enlarged extravagantly their discounts , thus enabling all other existing banks to do the same ; large dividends were declared , which , stimulating the cupidity of capitalists , caused a rush to be made to the legislatures of the respective states for similar acts of incorporation , which by many of the states , under a temporary infatuation , were readily granted , and thus the augmentation of the circulating medium , consisting almost exclusively of paper , produced a most fatal delusion .
an illustration derived from the land sales of the period alluded to will serve best to show the effect of the whole system .
the average sales of the public lands for a period of ten years prior to 1834 had not much exceeded $ 2,000,000 per annum .
in 1834 they attained in round numbers to the amount of $ 6,000,000 ; in the succeeding year of 1835 they reached $ 16,000,000 , and the next year of 1836 they amounted to the enormous sum of $ 25,000,000 , thus crowding into the short space of three years upward of twenty - three years ' purchase of the public domain .
so apparent had become the necessity of arresting this course of things that the executive department assumed the highly questionable power of discriminating in the funds to be used in payment by different classes of public debtors -- a discrimination which was doubtless designed to correct this most ruinous state of things by the exaction of specie in all payments for the public lands , but which could not at once arrest the tide which had so strongly set in .
hence the demands for specie became unceasing , and corresponding prostration rapidly ensued under the necessities created with the banks to curtail their discounts and thereby to reduce their circulation .
i recur to these things with no disposition to censure preexisting administrations of the government , but simply in exemplification of the truth of the position which i have assumed .
if , then , any fiscal agent which may be created shall be placed , without due restrictions , either in the hands of the administrators of the government or those of private individuals , the temptation to abuse will prove to be resistless .
objects of political aggrandizement may seduce the first , and the promptings of a boundless cupidity will assail the last .
aided by the experience of the past , it will be the pleasure of congress so to guard and fortify the public interests in the creation of any new agent as to place them , so far as human wisdom can accomplish it , on a footing of perfect security .
within a few years past three different schemes have been before the country .
the charter of the bank of the united states expired by its own limitations in 1836 .
an effort was made to renew it , which received the sanction of the two houses of congress , but the then president of the united states exercised his veto power and the measure was defeated .
a regard to truth requires me to say that the president was fully sustained in the course he had taken by the popular voice .
his successor to the chair of state unqualifiedly pronounced his opposition to any new charter of a similar institution , and not only the popular election which brought him into power , but the elections through much of his term , seemed clearly to indicate a concurrence with him in sentiment on the part of the people .
after the public moneys were withdrawn from the united states bank they were placed in deposit with the state banks , and the result of that policy has been before the country .
to say nothing as to the question whether that experiment was made under propitious or adverse circumstances , it may safely be asserted that it did receive the unqualified condemnation of most of its early advocates , and , it is believed , was also condemned by the popular sentiment .
the existing subtreasury system does not seem to stand in higher favor with the people , but has recently been condemned in a manner too plainly indicated to admit of a doubt .
thus in the short period of eight years the popular voice may be regarded as having successively condemned each of the three schemes of finance to which i have adverted .
as to the first , it was introduced at a time ( 1816 ) when the state banks , then comparatively few in number , had been forced to suspend specie payments by reason of the war which had previously prevailed with great britain .
whether if the united states bank charter , which expired in 1811 , had been renewed in due season it would have been enabled to continue specie payments during the war and the disastrous period to the commerce of the country which immediately succeeded is , to say the least , problematical , and whether the united states bank of 1816 produced a restoration of specie payments or the same was accomplished through the instrumentality of other means was a matter of some difficulty at that time to determine .
certain it is that for the first years of the operation of that bank its course was as disastrous as for the greater part of its subsequent career it became eminently successful .
as to the second , the experiment was tried with a redundant treasury , which continued to increase until it seemed to be the part of wisdom to distribute the surplus revenue among the states , which , operating at the same time with the specie circular and the causes before adverted to , caused them to suspend specie payments and involved the country in the greatest embarrassment .
and as to the third , if carried through all the stages of its transmutation from paper and specie to nothing but the precious metals , to say nothing of the insecurity of the public moneys , its injurious effects have been anticipated by the country in its unqualified condemnation .
what is now to be regarded as the judgment of the american people on this whole subject i have no accurate means of determining but by appealing to their more immediate representatives .
the late contest , which terminated in the election of general harrison to the presidency , was decided on principles well known and openly declared , and while the subtreasury received in the result the most decided condemnation , yet no other scheme of finance seemed to have been concurred in .
to you , then , who have come more directly from the body of our common constituents , i submit the entire question , as best qualified to give a full exposition of their wishes and opinions .
i shall be ready to concur with you in the adoption of such system as you may propose , reserving to myself the ultimate power of rejecting any measure which may , in my view of it , conflict with the constitution or otherwise jeopardize the prosperity of the country -- a power which i could not part with even if i would , but which i will not believe any act of yours will call into requisition .
i can not avoid recurring , in connection with this subject , to the necessity which exists for adopting some suitable measure whereby the unlimited creation of banks by the states may be corrected in future .
such result can be most readily achieved by the consent of the states , to be expressed in the form of a compact among themselves , which they can only enter into with the consent and approbation of this government -- a consent which might in the present emergency of the public demands justifiably be given by congress in advance of any action by the states , as an inducement to such action , upon terms well defined by the act of tender .
such a measure , addressing itself to the calm reflection of the states , would find in the experience of the past and the condition of the present much to sustain it ; and it is greatly to be doubted whether any scheme of finance can prove for any length of time successful while the states shall continue in the unrestrained exercise of the power of creating banking corporations .
this power can only be limited by their consent .
with the adoption of a financial agency of a satisfactory character the hope may be indulged that the country may once more return to a state of prosperity .
measures auxiliary thereto , and in some measure inseparably connected with its success , will doubtless claim the attention of congress .
among such , a distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands , provided such distribution does not force upon congress the necessity of imposing upon commerce heavier burthens than those contemplated by the act of 1833 , would act as an efficient remedial measure by being brought directly in aid of the states .
as one sincerely devoted to the task of preserving a just balance in our system of government by the maintenance of the states in a condition the most free and respectable and in the full possession of all their power , i can no otherwise than feel desirous for their emancipation from the situation to which the pressure on their finances now subjects them .
and while i must repudiate , as a measure founded in error and wanting constitutional sanction , the slightest approach to an assumption by this government of the debts of the states , yet i can see in the distribution adverted too much to recommend it .
the compacts between the proprietor states and this government expressly guarantee to the states all the benefits which may arise from the sales .
the mode by which this is to be effected addresses itself to the discretion of congress as the trustee for the states , and its exercise after the most beneficial manner is restrained by nothing in the grants or in the constitution so long as congress shall consult that equality in the distribution which the compacts require .
in the present condition of some of the states the question of distribution may be regarded as substantially a question between direct and indirect taxation .
if the distribution be not made in some form or other , the necessity will daily become more urgent with the debtor states for a resort to an oppressive system of direct taxation , or their credit , and necessarily their power and influence , will be greatly diminished .
the payment of taxes after the most inconvenient and oppressive mode will be exacted in place of contributions for the most part voluntarily made , and therefore comparatively unoppressive .
the states are emphatically the constituents of this government , and we should be entirely regardless of the objects held in view by them in the creation of this government if we could be indifferent to their good .
the happy effects of such a measure upon all the states would immediately be manifested .
with the debtor states it would effect the relief to a great extent of the citizens from a heavy burthen of direct taxation , which presses with severity on the laboring classes , and eminently assist in restoring the general prosperity .
an immediate advance would take place in the price of the state securities , and the attitude of the states would become once more , as it should ever be , lofty and erect .
with states laboring under no extreme pressure from debt , the fund which they would derive from this source would enable them to improve their condition in an eminent degree .
so far as this government is concerned , appropriations to domestic objects approaching in amount the revenue derived from the land sales might be abandoned , and thus a system of unequal , and therefore unjust , legislation would be substituted by one dispensing equality to all the members of this confederacy .
whether such distribution should be made directly to the states in the proceeds of the sales or in the form of profits by virtue of the operations of any fiscal agency having those proceeds as its basis , should such measure be contemplated by congress , would well deserve its consideration .
nor would such disposition of the proceeds of the sales in any manner prevent congress from time to time from passing all necessary preemption laws for the benefit of actual settlers , or from making any new arrangement as to the price of the public lands which might in future be esteemed desirable .
i beg leave particularly to call your attention to the accompanying report from the secretary of war .
besides the present state of the war which has so long afflicted the territory of florida , and the various other matters of interest therein referred to , you will learn from it that the secretary has instituted an inquiry into abuses , which promises to develop gross enormities in connection with indian treaties which have been negotiated , as well as in the expenditures for the removal and subsistence of the indians .
he represents also other irregularities of a serious nature that have grown up in the practice of the indian department , which will require the appropriation of upward of $ 200,000 to correct , and which claim the immediate attention of congress .
in reflecting on the proper means of defending the country we can not shut our eyes to the consequences which the introduction and use of the power of steam upon the ocean are likely to produce in wars between maritime states .
we can not yet see the extent to which this power may be applied in belligerent operations , connecting itself as it does with recent improvements in the science of gunnery and projectiles ; but we need have no fear of being left , in regard to these things , behind the most active and skillful of other nations if the genius and enterprise of our fellow - citizens receive proper encouragement and direction from government .
true wisdom would nevertheless seem to dictate the necessity of placing in perfect condition those fortifications which are designed for the protection of our principal cities and roadsteads .
for the defense of our extended maritime coast our chief reliance should be placed on our navy , aided by those inventions which are destined to recommend themselves to public adoption , but no time should be lost in placing our principal cities on the seaboard and the lakes in a state of entire security from foreign assault .
separated as we are from the countries of the old world , and in much unaffected by their policy , we are happily relieved from the necessity of maintaining large standing armies in times of peace .
the policy which was adopted by mr. monroe shortly after the conclusion of the late war with great britain of preserving a regularly organized staff sufficient for the command of a large military force should a necessity for one arise is rounded as well in economy as in true wisdom .
provision is thus made , upon filling up the rank and file , which can readily be done on any emergency , for the introduction of a system of discipline both promptly and efficiently .
all that is required in time of peace is to maintain a sufficient number of men to guard our fortifications , to meet any sudden contingency , and to encounter the first shock of war .
our chief reliance must be placed on the militia ; they constitute the great body of national guards , and , inspired by an ardent love of country , will be found ready at all times and at all seasons to repair with alacrity to its defense .
it will be regarded by congress , i doubt not , at a suitable time as one of its highest duties to attend to their complete organization and discipline .
the state of the navy pension fund requires the immediate attention of congress .
by the operation of the act of the 3d of march , 1837 , entitled " an act for the more equitable administration of the navy pension fund , " that fund has been exhausted .
it will be seen from the accompanying report of the commissioner of pensions that there will be required for the payment of navy pensions on the 1st of july next $ 88,706.06 1/3 , and on the 1st of january , 1842 , the sum of $ 69,000 .
in addition to these sums , about $ 6,000 will be required to pay arrears of pensions which will probably be allowed between the 1st of july and the 1st of january , 1842 , making in the whole $ 163,706.06 1/3 .
to meet these payments there is within the control of the department the sum of $ 28,040 , leaving a deficiency of $ 139,666.06 1/3 .
the public faith requires that immediate provision should be made for the payment of these sums .
in order to introduce into the navy a desirable efficiency , a new system of accountability may be found to be indispensably necessary .
to mature a plan having for its object the accomplishment of an end so important and to meet the just expectations of the country require more time than has yet been allowed to the secretary at the head of the department .
the hope is indulged that by the time of your next regular session measures of importance in connection with this branch of the public service may be matured for your consideration .
although the laws regulating the post - office department only require from the officer charged with its direction to report at the usual annual session of congress , the postmaster - general has presented to me some facts connected with the financial condition of the department which are deemed worthy the attention of congress .
by the accompanying report of that officer it appears the existing liabilities of that department beyond the means of payment at its command can not be less than $ 500,000 .
as the laws organizing that branch of the public service confine the expenditure to its own revenues , deficiencies therein can not be presented under the usual estimates for the expenses of government .
it must therefore be left to congress to determine whether the moneys now due the contractors shall be paid from the public treasury or whether that department shall continue under its present embarrassments .
it will be seen by the report of the postmaster - general that the recent lettings of contracts in several of the states have been made at such reduced rates of compensation as to encourage the belief that if the department was relieved from existing difficulties its future operations might be conducted without any further call upon the general treasury .
the power of appointing to office is one of a character the most delicate and responsible .
the appointing power is evermore exposed to be led into error .
with anxious solicitude to select the most trustworthy for official station , i can not be supposed to possess a personal knowledge of the qualifications of every applicant .
i deem it , therefore , proper in this most public manner to invite on the part of the senate a just scrutiny into the character and pretensions of every person i may bring to their notice in the regular form of a nomination for office .
unless persons every way trustworthy are employed in the public service , corruption and irregularity will inevitably follow .
i shall with the greatest cheerfulness acquiesce in the decision of that body , and , regarding it as wisely constituted to aid the executive department in the performance of this delicate duty , i shall look to its " consent and advice " as given only in furtherance of the best interests of the country .
i shall also at the earliest proper occasion invite the attention of congress to such measures as in my judgment will be best calculated to regulate and control the executive power in reference to this vitally important subject .
i shall also at the proper season invite your attention to the statutory enactments for the suppression of the slave trade , which may require to be rendered more efficient in their provisions .
there is reason to believe that the traffic is on the increase .
whether such increase is to be ascribed to the abolition of slave labor in the british possessions in our vicinity and an attendant diminution in the supply of those articles which enter into the general consumption of the world , thereby augmenting the demand from other quarters , and thus calling for additional labor , it were needless to inquire .
the highest considerations of public honor as well as the strongest promptings of humanity require a resort to the most vigorous efforts to suppress the trade .
in conclusion i beg to invite your particular attention to the interests of this district ; nor do i doubt but that in a liberal spirit of legislation you will seek to advance its commercial as well as its local interests .
should congress deem it to be its duty to repeal the existing subtreasury law , the necessity of providing a suitable place of deposit of the public moneys which may be required within the district must be apparent to all .
i have felt it due to the country to present the foregoing topics to your consideration and reflection .
others with which it might not seem proper to trouble you at an extraordinary session will be laid before you at a future day .
i am happy in committing the important affairs of the country into your hands .
the tendency of public sentiment , i am pleased to believe , is toward the adoption , in a spirit of union and harmony , of such measures as will fortify the public interests .
to cherish such a tendency of public opinion is the task of an elevated patriotism .
that differences of opinion as to the means of accomplishing these desirable objects should exist is reasonably to be expected .
nor can all be made satisfied with any system of measures ; but i flatter myself with the hope that the great body of the people will readily unite in support of those whose efforts spring from a disinterested desire to promote their happiness , to preserve the federal and state governments within their respective orbits ; to cultivate peace with all the nations of the earth on just and honorable grounds ; to exact obedience to the laws ; to intrench liberty and property in full security ; and , consulting the most rigid economy , to abolish all useless expenses .

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states : 
 we have continued reason to express our profound gratitude to the great creator of all things for numberless benefits conferred upon us as a people .
blessed with genial seasons , the husbandman has his garners filled with abundance , and the necessaries of life , not to speak of its luxuries , abound in every direction .
while in some other nations steady and industrious labor can hardly find the means of subsistence , the greatest evil which we have to encounter is a surplus of production beyond the home demand , which seeks , and with difficulty finds , a partial market in other regions .
the health of the country , with partial exceptions , has for the past year been well preserved , and under their free and wise institutions the united states are rapidly advancing toward the consummation of the high destiny which an overruling providence seems to have marked out for them .
exempt from domestic convulsion and at peace with all the world , we are left free to consult as to the best means of securing and advancing the happiness of the people .
such are the circumstances under which you now assemble in your respective chambers and which should lead us to unite in praise and thanksgiving to that great being who made us and who preserves us as a nation .
i congratulate you , fellow - citizens , on the happy change in the aspect of our foreign affairs since my last annual message .
causes of complaint at that time existed between the united states and great britain which , attended by irritating circumstances , threatened most seriously the public peace .
the difficulty of adjusting amicably the questions at issue between the two countries was in no small degree augmented by the lapse of time since they had their origin .
the opinions entertained by the executive on several of the leading topics in dispute were frankly set forth in the message at the opening of your late session .
the appointment of a special minister by great britain to the united states with power to negotiate upon most of the points of difference indicated a desire on her part amicably to adjust them , and that minister was met by the executive in the same spirit which had dictated his mission .
the treaty consequent thereon having been duly ratified by the two governments , a copy , together with the correspondence which accompanied it , is herewith communicated .
i trust that whilst you may see in it nothing objectionable , it may be the means of preserving for an indefinite period the amicable relations happily existing between the two governments .
the question of peace or war between the united states and great britain is a question of the deepest interest , not only to themselves , but to the civilized world , since it is scarcely possible that a war could exist between them without endangering the peace of christendom .
the immediate effect of the treaty upon ourselves will be felt in the security afforded to mercantile enterprise , which , no longer apprehensive of interruption , adventures its speculations in the most distant seas , and , freighted with the diversified productions of every land , returns to bless our own .
there is nothing in the treaty which in the slightest degree compromits the honor or dignity of either nation .
next to the settlement of the boundary line , which must always be a matter of difficulty between states as between individuals , the question which seemed to threaten the greatest embarrassment was that connected with the african slave trade .
by the tenth article of the treaty of ghent it was expressly declared that-- 
 whereas the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice , and whereas both his majesty and the united states are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition , it is hereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object .
in the enforcement of the laws and treaty stipulations of great britain a practice had threatened to grow up on the part of its cruisers of subjecting to visitation ships sailing under the american flag , which , while it seriously involved our maritime rights , would subject to vexation a branch of our trade which was daily increasing , and which required the fostering care of government .
and although lord aberdeen in his correspondence with the american envoys at london expressly disclaimed all right to detain an american ship on the high seas , even if found with a cargo of slaves on board , and restricted the british pretension to a mere claim to visit and inquire , yet it could not well be discerned by the executive of the united states how such visit and inquiry could be made without detention on the voyage and consequent interruption to the trade .
it was regarded as the right of search presented only in a new form and expressed in different words , and i therefore felt it to be my duty distinctly to declare in my annual message to congress that no such concession could be made , and that the united states had both the will and the ability to enforce their own laws and to protect their flag from being used for purposes wholly forbidden by those laws and obnoxious to the moral censure of the world .
taking the message as his letter of instructions , our then minister at paris felt himself required to assume the same ground in a remonstrance which he felt it to be his duty to present to mr. guizot , and through him to the king of the french , against what has been called the " quintuple treaty ; " and his conduct in this respect met with the approval of this government .
in close conformity with these views the eighth article of the treaty was framed ; which provides " that each nation shall keep afloat in the african seas a force not less than 80 guns , to act separately and apart , under instructions from their respective governments , and for the enforcement of their respective laws and obligations . "
from this it will be seen that the ground assumed in the message has been fully maintained at the same time that the stipulations of the treaty of ghent are to be carried out in good faith by the two countries , and that all pretense is removed for interference with our commerce for any purpose whatever by a foreign government .
while , therefore , the united states have been standing up for the freedom of the seas , they have not thought proper to make that a pretext for avoiding a fulfillment of their treaty stipulations or a ground for giving countenance to a trade reprobated by our laws .
a similar arrangement by the other great powers could not fail to sweep from the ocean the slave trade without the interpolation of any new principle into the maritime code .
we may be permitted to hope that the example thus set will be followed by some if not all of them .
we thereby also afford suitable protection to the fair trader in those seas , thus fulfilling at the same time the dictates of a sound policy and complying with the claims of justice and humanity .
it would have furnished additional cause for congratulation if the treaty could have embraced all subjects calculated in future to lead to a misunderstanding between the two governments .
the territory of the united states commonly called the oregon territory , lying on the pacific ocean north of the forty - second degree of latitude , to a portion of which great britain lays claim , begins to attract the attention of our fellow - citizens , and the tide of population which has reclaimed what was so lately an unbroken wilderness in more contiguous regions is preparing to flow over those vast districts which stretch from the rocky mountains to the pacific ocean .
in advance of the acquirement of individual rights to these lands , sound policy dictates that every effort should be resorted to by the two governments to settle their respective claims .
it became manifest at an early hour of the late negotiations that any attempt for the time being satisfactorily to determine those rights would lead to a protracted discussion , which might embrace in its failure other more pressing matters , and the executive did not regard it as proper to waive all the advantages of an honorable adjustment of other difficulties of great magnitude and importance because this , not so immediately pressing , stood in the way .
although the difficulty referred to may not for several years to come involve the peace of the two countries , yet i shall not delay to urge on great britain the importance of its early settlement .
nor will other matters of commercial importance to the two countries be overlooked , and i have good reason to believe that it will comport with the policy of england , as it does with that of the united states , to seize upon this moment , when most of the causes of irritation have passed away , to cement the peace and amity of the two countries by wisely removing all grounds of probable future collision .
with the other powers of europe our relations continue on the most amicable footing .
treaties now existing with them should be rigidly observed , and every opportunity compatible with the interests of the united states should be seized upon to enlarge the basis of commercial intercourse .
peace with all the world is the true foundation of our policy , which can only be rendered permanent by the practice of equal and impartial justice to all .
our great desire should be to enter only into that rivalry which looks to the general good in the cultivation of the sciences , the enlargement of the field for the exercise of the mechanical arts , and the spread of commerce -- that great civilizer -- to every land and sea .
carefully abstaining from interference in all questions exclusively referring themselves to the political interests of europe , we may be permitted to hope an equal exemption from the interference of european governments in what relates to the states of the american continent .
on the 23d of april last the commissioners on the part of the united states under the convention with the mexican republic of the 11th of april , 1839 , made to the proper department a final report in relation to the proceedings of the commission .
from this it appears that the total amount awarded to the claimants by the commissioners and the umpire appointed under that convention was $ 2,026,079.68 .
the arbiter having considered that his functions were required by the convention to terminate at the same time with those of the commissioners , returned to the board , undecided for want of time , claims which had been allowed by the american commissioners to the amount of $ 928,620.88 .
other claims , in which the amount sought to be recovered was $ 3,336,837.05 , were submitted to the board too late for its consideration .
the minister of the united states at mexico has been duly authorized to make demand for payment of the awards according to the terms of the convention and the provisions of the act of congress of the 12th of june , 1840 .
he has also been instructed to communicate to that government the expectations of the government of the united states in relation to those claims which were not disposed of according to the provisions of the convention , and all others of citizens of the united states against the mexican government .
he has also been furnished with other instructions , to be followed by him in case the government of mexico should not find itself in a condition to make present payment of the amount of the awards in specie or its equivalent .
i am happy to be able to say that information which is esteemed favorable both to a just satisfaction of the awards and a reasonable provision for other claims has been recently received from mr. thompson , the minister of the united states , who has promptly and efficiently executed the instructions of his government in regard to this important subject .
the citizens of the united states who accompanied the late texan expedition to santa fe , and who were wrongfully taken and held as prisoners of war in mexico , have all been liberated .
a correspondence has taken place between the department of state and the mexican minister of foreign affairs upon the complaint of mexico that citizens of the united states were permitted to give aid to the inhabitants of texas in the war existing between her and that republic .
copies of this correspondence are herewith communicated to congress , together with copies of letters on the same subject addressed to the diplomatic corps at mexico by the american minister and the mexican secretary of state .
mexico has thought proper to reciprocate the mission of the united states to that government by accrediting to this a minister of the same rank as that of the representative of the united states in mexico .
from the circumstances connected with his mission favorable results are anticipated from it .
it is so obviously for the interest of both countries as neighbors and friends that all just causes of mutual dissatisfaction should be removed that it is to be hoped neither will omit or delay the employment of any practicable and honorable means to accomplish that end .
the affairs pending between this government and several others of the states of this hemisphere formerly under the dominion of spain have again within the past year been materially obstructed by the military revolutions and conflicts in those countries .
the ratifications of the treaty between the united states and the republic of ecuador of the 13th of june , 1839 , have been exchanged , and that instrument has been duly promulgated on the part of this government .
copies are now communicated to congress with a view to enable that body to make such changes in the laws applicable to our intercourse with that republic as may be deemed requisite .
provision has been made by the government of chile for the payment of the claim on account of the illegal detention of the brig warrior at coquimbo in 1820 .
this government has reason to expect that other claims of our citizens against chile will be hastened to a final and satisfactory close .
the empire of brazil has not been altogether exempt from those convulsions which so constantly afflict the neighboring republics .
disturbances which recently broke out are , however , now understood to be quieted .
but these occurrences , by threatening the stability of the governments , or by causing incessant and violent changes in them or in the persons who administer them , tend greatly to retard provisions for a just indemnity for losses and injuries suffered by individual subjects or citizens of other states .
the government of the united states will feel it to be its duty , however , to consent to no delay not unavoidable in making satisfaction for wrongs and injuries sustained by its own citizens .
many years having in some cases elapsed , a decisive and effectual course of proceeding will be demanded of the respective governments against whom claims have been preferred .
the vexatious , harassing , and expensive war which so long prevailed with the indian tribes inhabiting the peninsula of florida has happily been terminated , whereby our army has been relieved from a service of the most disagreeable character and the treasury from a large expenditure .
some casual outbreaks may occur , such as are incident to the close proximity of border settlers and the indians , but these , as in all other cases , may be left to the care of the local authorities , aided when occasion may require by the forces of the united states .
a sufficient number of troops will be maintained in florida so long as the remotest apprehensions of danger shall exist , yet their duties will be limited rather to the garrisoning of the necessary posts than to the maintenance of active hostilities .
it is to be hoped that a territory so long retarded in its growth will now speedily recover from the evils incident to a protracted war , exhibiting in the increased amount of its rich productions true evidences of returning wealth and prosperity .
by the practice of rigid justice toward the numerous indian tribes residing within our territorial limits and the exercise of a parental vigilance over their interests , protecting them against fraud and intrusion , and at the same time using every proper expedient to introduce among them the arts of civilized life , we may fondly hope not only to wean them from their love of war , but to inspire them with a love for peace and all its avocations .
with several of the tribes great progress in civilizing them has already been made .
the schoolmaster and the missionary are found side by side , and the remnants of what were once numerous and powerful nations may yet be preserved as the builders up of a new name for themselves and their posterity .
the balance in the treasury on the 1st of january , 1842 , exclusive of the amount deposited with the states , trust funds , and indemnities , was $ 230,483.68 .
the receipts into the treasury during the three first quarters of the present year from all sources amount to $ 26,616,593.78 , of which more than fourteen millions were received from customs and about one million from the public lands .
the receipts for the fourth quarter are estimated at nearly eight millions , of which four millions are expected from customs and three millions and a half from loans and treasury notes .
the expenditures of the first three quarters of the present year exceed twenty - six millions , and those estimated for the fourth quarter amount to about eight millions ; and it is anticipated there will be a deficiency of half a million on the 1st of january next , but that the amount of outstanding warrants ( estimated at $ 800,000 ) will leave an actual balance of about $ 224,000 in the treasury .
among the expenditures of this year are more than eight millions for the public debt and about $ 600,000 on account of the distribution to the states of the proceeds of sales of the public lands .
the present tariff of duties was somewhat hastily and hurriedly passed near the close of the late session of congress .
that it should have defects can therefore be surprising to no one .
to remedy such defects as may be found to exist in any of its numerous provisions will not fail to claim your serious attention .
it may well merit inquiry whether the exaction of all duties in cash does not call for the introduction of a system which has proved highly beneficial in countries where it has been adopted .
i refer to the warehousing system .
the first and most prominent effect which it would produce would be to protect the market alike against redundant or deficient supplies of foreign fabrics , both of which in the long run are injurious as well to the manufacturer as the importer .
the quantity of goods in store being at all times readily known , it would enable the importer with an approach to accuracy to ascertain the actual wants of the market and to regulate himself accordingly .
if , however , he should fall into error by importing an excess above the public wants , he could readily correct its evils by availing himself of the benefits and advantages of the system thus established .
in the storehouse the goods imported would await the demand of the market and their issues would be governed by the fixed principles of demand and supply .
thus an approximation would be made to a steadiness and uniformity of price , which if attainable would conduce to the decided advantage of mercantile and mechanical operations .
the apprehension may be well entertained that without something to ameliorate the rigor of cash payments the entire import trade may fall into the hands of a few wealthy capitalists in this country and in europe .
the small importer , who requires all the money he can raise for investments abroad , and who can but ill afford to pay the lowest duty , would have to subduct in advance a portion of his funds in order to pay the duties , and would lose the interest upon the amount thus paid for all the time the goods might remain unsold , which might absorb his profits .
the rich capitalist , abroad as well as at home , would thus possess after a short time an almost exclusive monopoly of the import trade , and laws designed for the benefit of all would thus operate for the benefit of a few -- a result wholly uncongenial with the spirit of our institutions and antirepublican in all its tendencies .
the warehousing system would enable the importer to watch the market and to select his own time for offering his goods for sale .
a profitable portion of the carrying trade in articles entered for the benefit of drawback must also be most seriously affected without the adoption of some expedient to relieve the cash system .
the warehousing system would afford that relief , since the carrier would have a safe recourse to the public storehouses and might without advancing the duty reship within some reasonable period to foreign ports .
a further effect of the measure would be to supersede the system of drawbacks , thereby effectually protecting the government against fraud , as the right of debenture would not attach to goods after their withdrawal from the public stores .
in revising the existing tariff of duties , should you deem it proper to do so at your present session , i can only repeat the suggestions and recommendations which upon several occasions i have heretofore felt it to be my duty to offer to congress .
the great primary and controlling interest of the american people is union -- union not only in the mere forms of government , forms which may be broken , but union rounded in an attachment of states and individuals for each other .
this union in sentiment and feeling can only be preserved by the adoption of that course of policy which , neither giving exclusive benefits to some nor imposing unnecessary burthens upon others , shall consult the interests of all by pursuing a course of moderation and thereby seeking to harmonize public opinion , and causing the people everywhere to feel and to know that the government is careful of the interests of all alike .
nor is there any subject in regard to which moderation , connected with a wise discrimination , is more necessary than in the imposition of duties on imports .
whether reference be had to revenue , the primary object in the imposition of taxes , or to the incidents which necessarily flow from their imposition , this is entirely true .
extravagant duties defeat their end and object , not only by exciting in the public mind an hostility to the manufacturing interests , but by inducing a system of smuggling on an extensive scale and the practice of every manner of fraud upon the revenue , which the utmost vigilance of government can not effectually suppress .
an opposite course of policy would be attended by results essentially different , of which every interest of society , and none more than those of the manufacturer , would reap important advantages .
among the most striking of its benefits would be that derived from the general acquiescence of the country in its support and the consequent permanency and stability which would be given to all the operations of industry .
it can not be too often repeated that no system of legislation can be wise which is fluctuating and uncertain .
no interest can thrive under it .
the prudent capitalist will never adventure his capital in manufacturing establishments , or in any other leading pursuit of life , if there exists a state of uncertainty as to whether the government will repeal to - morrow what it has enacted to - day .
fitful profits , however high , if threatened with a ruinous reduction by a vacillating policy on the part of government , will scarcely tempt him to trust the money which he has acquired by a life of labor upon the uncertain adventure .
i therefore , in the spirit of conciliation , and influenced by no other desire than to rescue the great interests of the country from the vortex of political contention , and in the discharge of the high and solemn duties of the place which i now occupy , recommend moderate duties , imposed with a wise discrimination as to their several objects , as being not only most likely to be durable , but most advantageous to every interest of society .
the report of the secretary of the war department exhibits a very full and satisfactory account of the various and important interests committed to the charge of that officer .
it is particularly gratifying to find that the expenditures for the military service are greatly reduced in amount -- that a strict system of economy has been introduced into the service and the abuses of past years greatly reformed .
the fortifications on our maritime frontier have been prosecuted with much vigor , and at many points our defenses are in a very considerable state of forwardness .
the suggestions in reference to the establishment of means of communication with our territories on the pacific and to the surveys so essential to a knowledge of the resources of the intermediate country are entitled to the most favorable consideration .
while i would propose nothing inconsistent with friendly negotiations to settle the extent of our claims in that region , yet a prudent forecast points out the necessity of such measures as may enable us to maintain our rights .
the arrangements made for preserving our neutral relations on the boundary between us and texas and keeping in check the indians in that quarter will be maintained so long as circumstances may require .
for several years angry contentions have grown out of the disposition directed by law to be made of the mineral lands held by the government in several of the states .
the government is constituted the landlord , and the citizens of the states wherein lie the lands are its tenants .
the relation is an unwise one , and it would be much more conducive of the public interest that a sale of the lands should be made than that they should remain in their present condition .
the supply of the ore would be more abundantly and certainly furnished when to be drawn from the enterprise and the industry of the proprietor than under the present system .
the recommendations of the secretary in regard to the improvements of the western waters and certain prominent harbors on the lakes merit , and i doubt not will receive , your serious attention .
the great importance of these subjects to the prosperity of the extensive region referred to and the security of the whole country in time of war can not escape observation .
the losses of life and property which annually occur in the navigation of the mississippi alone because of the dangerous obstructions in the river make a loud demand upon congress for the adoption of efficient measures for their removal .
the report of the secretary of the navy will bring you acquainted with that important branch of the public defenses .
considering the already vast and daily increasing commerce of the country , apart from the exposure to hostile inroad of an extended seaboard , all that relates to the navy is calculated to excite particular attention .
whatever tends to add to its efficiency without entailing unnecessary charges upon the treasury is well worthy of your serious consideration .
it will be seen that while an appropriation exceeding by more than a million the appropriations of the current year is asked by the secretary , yet that in this sum is proposed to be included $ 400,000 for the purchase of clothing , which when once expended will be annually reimbursed by the sale of the clothes , and will thus constitute a perpetual fund without any new appropriation to the same object .
to this may also be added $ 50,000 asked to cover the arrearages of past years and $ 250,000 in order to maintain a competent squadron on the coast of africa ; all of which when deducted will reduce the expenditures nearly within the limits of those of the current year .
while , however , the expenditures will thus remain very nearly the same as of the antecedent year , it is proposed to add greatly to the operations of the marine , and in lieu of only 25 ships in commission and but little in the way of building , to keep with the same expenditure 41 vessels afloat and to build 12 ships of a small class .
a strict system of accountability is established and great pains are taken to insure industry , fidelity , and economy in every department of duty .
experiments have been instituted to test the quality of various materials , particularly copper , iron , and coal , so as to prevent fraud and imposition .
it will appear by the report of the postmaster - general that the great point which for several years has been so much desired has during the current year been fully accomplished .
the expenditures of the department for current service have been brought within its income without lessening its general usefulness .
there has been an increase of revenue equal to $ 166,000 for the year 1842 over that of 1841 , without , as it is believed , any addition having been made to the number of letters and newspapers transmitted through the mails .
the post - office laws have been honestly administered , and fidelity has been observed in accounting for and paying over by the subordinates of the department the moneys which have been received .
for the details of the service i refer you to the report .
i flatter myself that the exhibition thus made of the condition of the public administration will serve to convince you that every proper attention has been paid to the interests of the country by those who have been called to the heads of the different departments .
the reduction in the annual expenditures of the government already accomplished furnishes a sure evidence that economy in the application of the public moneys is regarded as a paramount duty .
at peace with all the world , the personal liberty of the citizen sacredly maintained and his rights secured under political institutions deriving all their authority from the direct sanction of the people , with a soil fertile almost beyond example and a country blessed with every diversity of climate and production , what remains to be done in order to advance the happiness and prosperity of such a people ?
under ordinary circumstances this inquiry could readily be answered .
the best that probably could be done for a people inhabiting such a country would be to fortify their peace and security in the prosecution of their various pursuits by guarding them against invasion from without and violence from within .
the rest for the greater part might be left to their own energy and enterprise .
the chief embarrassments which at the moment exhibit themselves have arisen from overaction , and the most difficult task which remains to be accomplished is that of correcting and overcoming its effects .
between the years 1833 and 1838 additions were made to bank capital and bank issues , in the form of notes designed for circulation , to an extent enormously great .
the question seemed to be not how the best currency could be provided , but in what manner the greatest amount of bank paper could be put in circulation .
thus a vast amount of what was called money -- since for the time being it answered the purposes of money -- was thrown upon the country , an overissue which was attended , as a necessary consequence , by an extravagant increase of the prices of all articles of property , the spread of a speculative mania all over the country , and has finally ended in a general indebtedness on the part of states and individuals , the prostration of public and private credit , a depreciation in the market value of real and personal estate , and has left large districts of country almost entirely without any circulating medium .
in view of the fact that in 1830 the whole bank - note circulation within the united states amounted to but $ 61,323,898 , according to the treasury statements , and that an addition had been made thereto of the enormous sum of $ 88,000,000 in seven years ( the circulation on the 1st of january , 1837 , being stated at $ 149,185,890 ) , aided by the great facilities afforded in obtaining loans from european capitalists , who were seized with the same speculative mania which prevailed in the united states , and the large importations of funds from abroad -- the result of stock sales and loans -- no one can be surprised at the apparent but unsubstantial state of prosperity which everywhere prevailed over the land ; and as little cause of surprise should be felt at the present prostration of everything and the ruin which has befallen so many of our fellow - citizens in the sudden withdrawal from circulation of so large an amount of bank issues since 1837 - -exceeding , as is believed , the amount added to the paper currency for a similar period antecedent to 1837 - -it ceases to be a matter of astonishment that such extensive shipwreck should have been made of private fortunes or that difficulties should exist in meeting their engagements on the part of the debtor states ; apart from which , if there be taken into account the immense losses sustained in the dishonor of numerous banks , it is less a matter of surprise that insolvency should have visited many of our fellow - citizens than that so many should have escaped the blighting influences of the times .
in the solemn conviction of these truths and with an ardent desire to meet the pressing necessities of the country , i felt it to be my duty to cause to be submitted to you at the commencement of your last session the plan of an exchequer , the whole power and duty of maintaining which in purity and vigor was to be exercised by the representatives of the people and the states , and therefore virtually by the people themselves .
it was proposed to place it under the control and direction of a treasury board to consist of three commissioners , whose duty it should be to see that the law of its creation was faithfully executed and that the great end of supplying a paper medium of exchange at all times convertible into gold and silver should be attained .
the board thus constituted was given as much permanency as could be imparted to it without endangering the proper share of responsibility which should attach to all public agents .
in order to insure all the advantages of a well - matured experience , the commissioners were to hold their offices for the respective periods of two , four , and six years , thereby securing at all times in the management of the exchequer the services of two men of experience ; and to place them in a condition to exercise perfect independence of mind and action it was provided that their removal should only take place for actual incapacity or infidelity to the trust , and to be followed by the president with an exposition of the causes of such removal , should it occur .
it was proposed to establish subordinate boards in each of the states , under the same restrictions and limitations of the power of removal , which , with the central board , should receive , safely keep , and disburse the public moneys .
and in order to furnish a sound paper medium of exchange the exchequer should retain of the revenues of the government a sum not to exceed $ 5,000,000 in specie , to be set apart as required by its operations , and to pay the public creditor at his own option either in specie or treasury notes of denominations not less than $ 5 nor exceeding $ 100 , which notes should be redeemed at the several places of issue , and to be receivable at all times and everywhere in payment of government dues , with a restraint upon such issue of bills that the same should not exceed the maximum of $ 15,000,000 .
in order to guard against all the hazards incident to fluctuations in trade , the secretary of the treasury was invested with authority to issue $ 5,000,000 of government stock , should the same at any time be regarded as necessary in order to place beyond hazard the prompt redemption of the bills which might be thrown into circulation ; thus in fact making the issue of $ 15,000,000 of exchequer bills rest substantially on $ 10,000,000 , and keeping in circulation never more than one and one - half dollars for every dollar in specie .
when to this it is added that the bills are not only everywhere receivable in government dues , but that the government itself would be bound for their ultimate redemption , no rational doubt can exist that the paper which the exchequer would furnish would readily enter into general circulation and be maintained at all times at or above par with gold and silver , thereby realizing the great want of the age and fulfilling the wishes of the people .
in order to reimburse the government the expenses of the plan , it was proposed to invest the exchequer with the limited authority to deal in bills of exchange ( unless prohibited by the state in which an agency might be situated ) having only thirty days to run and resting on a fair and bona fide basis .
the legislative will on this point might be so plainly announced as to avoid all pretext for partiality or favoritism .
it was furthermore proposed to invest this treasury agent with authority to receive on deposit to a limited amount the specie funds of individuals and to grant certificates therefor to be redeemed on presentation , under the idea , which is believed to be well founded , that such certificates would come in aid of the exchequer bills in supplying a safe and ample paper circulation .
or if in place of the contemplated dealings in exchange the exchequer should be authorized not only to exchange its bills for actual deposits of specie , but , for specie or its equivalent , to sell drafts , charging therefor a small but reasonable premium , i can not doubt but that the benefits of the law would be speedily manifested in the revival of the credit , trade , and business of the whole country .
entertaining this opinion , it becomes my duty to urge its adoption upon congress by reference to the strongest considerations of the public interests , with such alterations in its details as congress may in its wisdom see fit to make .
i am well aware that this proposed alteration and amendment of the laws establishing the treasury department has encountered various objections , and that among others it has been proclaimed a government bank of fearful and dangerous import .
it is proposed to confer upon it no extraordinary power .
it purports to do no more than pay the debts of the government with the redeemable paper of the government , in which respect it accomplishes precisely what the treasury does daily at this time in issuing to the public creditors the treasury notes which under law it is authorized to issue .
it has no resemblance to an ordinary bank , as it furnishes no profits to private stockholders and lends no capital to individuals .
if it be objected to as a government bank and the objection be available , then should all the laws in relation to the treasury be repealed and the capacity of the government to collect what is due to it or pay what it owes be abrogated .
this is the chief purpose of the proposed exchequer , and surely if in the accomplishment of a purpose so essential it affords a sound circulating medium to the country and facilities to trade it should be regarded as no slight recommendation of it to public consideration .
properly guarded by the provisions of law , it can run into no dangerous evil , nor can any abuse arise under it but such as the legislature itself will be answerable for if it be tolerated , since it is but the creature of the law and is susceptible at all times of modification , amendment , or repeal at the pleasure of congress .
i know that it has been objected that the system would be liable to be abused by the legislature , by whom alone it could be abused , in the party conflicts of the day ; that such abuse would manifest itself in a change of the law which would authorize an excessive issue of paper for the purpose of inflating prices and winning popular favor .
to that it may be answered that the ascription of such a motive to congress is altogether gratuitous and inadmissible .
the theory of our institutions would lead us to a different conclusion .
but a perfect security against a proceeding so reckless would be found to exist in the very nature of things .
the political party which should be so blind to the true interests of the country as to resort to such an expedient would inevitably meet with final overthrow in the fact that the moment the paper ceased to be convertible into specie or otherwise promptly redeemed it would become worthless , and would in the end dishonor the government , involve the people in ruin and such political party in hopeless disgrace .
at the same time , such a view involves the utter impossibility of furnishing any currency other than that of the precious metals ; for if the government itself can not forego the temptation of excessive paper issues what reliance can be placed in corporations upon whom the temptations of individual aggrandizement would most strongly operate ?
the people would have to blame none but themselves for any injury that might arise from a course so reckless , since their agents would be the wrongdoers and they the passive spectators .
there can be but three kinds of public currency -- first , gold and silver ; second , the paper of state institutions ; or , third , a representative of the precious metals provided by the general government or under its authority .
the subtreasury system rejected the last in any form , and as it was believed that no reliance could be placed on the issues of local institutions for the purposes of general circulation it necessarily and unavoidably adopted specie as the exclusive currency for its own use ; and this must ever be the case unless one of the other kinds be used .
the choice in the present state of public sentiment lies between an exclusive specie currency on the one hand and government issues of some kind on the other .
that these issues can not be made by a chartered institution is supposed to be conclusively settled .
they must be made , then , directly by government agents .
for several years past they have been thus made in the form of treasury notes , and have answered a valuable purpose .
their usefulness has been limited by their being transient and temporary ; their ceasing to bear interest at given periods necessarily causes their speedy return and thus restricts their range of circulation , and being used only in the disbursements of government they can not reach those points where they are most required .
by rendering their use permanent , to the moderate extent already mentioned , by offering no inducement for their return and by exchanging them for coin and other values , they will constitute to a certain extent the general currency so much needed to maintain the internal trade of the country .
and this is the exchequer plan so far as it may operate in furnishing a currency .
i can not forego the occasion to urge its importance to the credit of the government in a financial point of view .
the great necessity of resorting to every proper and becoming expedient in order to place the treasury on a footing of the highest respectability is entirely obvious .
the credit of the government may be regarded as the very soul of the government itself -- a principle of vitality without which all its movements are languid and all its operations embarrassed .
in this spirit the executive felt itself bound by the most imperative sense of duty to submit to congress at its last session the propriety of making a specific pledge of the land fund as the basis for the negotiation of the loans authorized to be contracted .
i then thought that such an application of the public domain would without doubt have placed at the command of the government ample funds to relieve the treasury from the temporary embarrassments under which it labored .
american credit has suffered a considerable shock in europe from the large indebtedness of the states and the temporary inability of some of them to meet the interest on their debts .
the utter and disastrous prostration of the united states bank of pennsylvania had contributed largely to increase the sentiment of distrust by reason of the loss and ruin sustained by the holders of its stock , a large portion of whom were foreigners and many of whom were alike ignorant of our political organization and of our actual responsibilities .
it was the anxious desire of the executive that in the effort to negotiate the loan abroad the american negotiator might be able to point the money lender to the fund mortgaged for the redemption of the principal and interest of any loan he might contract , and thereby vindicate the government from all suspicion of bad faith or inability to meet its engagements .
congress differed from the executive in this view of the subject .
it became , nevertheless , the duty of the executive to resort to every expedient in its power to do so .
after a failure in the american market a citizen of high character and talent was sent to europe , with no better success ; and thus the mortifying spectacle has been presented of the inability of this government to obtain a loan so small as not in the whole to amount to more than one - fourth of its ordinary annual income , at a time when the governments of europe , although involved in debt and with their subjects heavily burthened with taxation , readily obtained loans of any amount at a greatly reduced rate of interest .
it would be unprofitable to look further into this anomalous state of things , but i can not conclude without adding that for a government which has paid off its debts of two wars with the largest maritime power of europe , and now owing a debt which is almost next to nothing when compared with its boundless resources -- a government the strongest in the world , because emanating from the popular will and firmly rooted in the affections of a great and free people , and whose fidelity to its engagements has never been questioned -- for such a government to have tendered to the capitalists of other countries an opportunity for a small investment in its stock , and yet to have failed , implies either the most unfounded distrust in its good faith or a purpose to obtain which the course pursued is the most fatal which could have been adopted .
it has now become obvious to all men that the government must look to its own means for supplying its wants , and it is consoling to know that these means are altogether adequate for the object .
the exchequer , if adopted , will greatly aid in bringing about this result .
upon what i regard as a well - rounded supposition that its bills would be readily sought for by the public creditors and that the issue would in a short time reach the maximum of $ 15,000,000 , it is obvious that $ 10,000,000 would thereby be added to the available means of the treasury without cost or charge .
nor can i fail to urge the great and beneficial effects which would be produced in aid of all the active pursuits of life .
its effects upon the solvent state banks , while it would force into liquidation those of an opposite character through its weekly settlements , would be highly beneficial ; and with the advantages of a sound currency the restoration of confidence and credit would follow with a numerous train of blessings .
my convictions are most strong that these benefits would flow from the adoption of this measure ; but if the result should be adverse there is this security in connection with it -- that the law creating it may be repealed at the pleasure of the legislature without the slightest implication of its good faith .
i recommend to congress to take into consideration the propriety of reimbursing a fine imposed on general jackson at new orleans at the time of the attack and defense of that city , and paid by him .
without designing any reflection on the judicial tribunal which imposed the fine , the remission at this day may be regarded as not unjust or inexpedient .
the voice of the civil authority was heard amidst the glitter of arms and obeyed by those who held the sword , thereby giving additional luster to a memorable military achievement .
if the laws were offended , their majesty was fully vindicated ; and although the penalty incurred and paid is worthy of little regard in a pecuniary point of view , it can hardly be doubted that it would be gratifying to the war - worn veteran , now in retirement and in the winter of his days , to be relieved from the circumstances in which that judgment placed him .
there are cases in which public functionaries may be called on to weigh the public interest against their own personal hazards , and if the civil law be violated from praiseworthy motives or an overruling sense of public danger and public necessity punishment may well be restrained within that limit which asserts and maintains the authority of the law and the subjection of the military to the civil power .
the defense of new orleans , while it saved a city from the hands of the enemy , placed the name of general jackson among those of the greatest captains of the age and illustrated one of the brightest pages of our history .
now that the causes of excitement existing at the time have ceased to operate , it is believed that the remission of this fine and whatever of gratification that remission might cause the eminent man who incurred and paid it would be in accordance with the general feeling and wishes of the american people .
i have thus , fellow - citizens , acquitted myself of my duty under the constitution by laying before you as succinctly as i have been able the state of the union and by inviting your attention to measures of much importance to the country .
the executive will most zealously unite its efforts with those of the legislative department in the accomplishment of all that is required to relieve the wants of a common constituency or elevate the destinies of a beloved country .

to the house of representatives : 
 in compliance with a resolution of the house of representatives of the 23d of march last , requesting the president to lay before the house " the authority and the true copies of all requests and applications upon which he deemed it his duty to interfere with the naval and military forces of the united states on the occasion of the recent attempt of the people of rhode island to establish a free constitution in the place of the old charter government of that state ; also copies of the instructions to and statements of the charter commissioners sent to him by the then existing authorities of the state of rhode island ; also copies of the correspondence between the executive of the united states and the charter government of the state of rhode island , and all the papers and documents connected with the same ; also copies of the correspondence , if any , between the heads of departments and said charter government or any person or persons connected with the said government , and of any accompanying papers and documents ; also copies of all orders issued by the executive of the united states , or any of the departments , to military officers for the movement or employment of troops to or in rhode island ; also copies of all orders to naval officers to prepare steam or other vessels of the united states for service in the waters of rhode island ; also copies of all orders to the officers of revenue cutters for the same service ; also copies of any instructions borne by the secretary of war to rhode island on his visit in 1842 to review the troops of the charter government ; also copies of any order or orders to any officer or officers of the army or navy to report themselves to the charter government ; and that he be requested to lay before this house copies of any other papers or documents in the possession of the executive connected with this subject not above specifically enumerated , " i have to inform the house that the executive did not deem it his " duty to interfere with the naval and military forces of the united states " in the late disturbances in rhode island ; that no orders were issued by the executive or any of the departments to military officers for the movement or employment of troops to or in rhode island other than those which accompany this message and which contemplated the strengthening of the garrison at fort adams , which , considering the extent of the agitation in rhode island , was esteemed necessary and judicious ; that no orders were issued to naval officers to prepare steam or other vessels of the united states for service in the waters of rhode island ; that no orders were issued " to the officers of the revenue cutters for said service ; " that no instructions were borne by " the secretary of war to rhode island on his visit in 1842 to review the troops of the charter government ; " that no orders were given to any officer or officers of the army or navy to report themselves to the charter government ; that " requests and applications " were made to the executive to fulfill the guaranties of the constitution which impose on the federal government the obligation to protect and defend each state of the union against " domestic violence and foreign invasion , " but the executive was at no time convinced that the casus faederis had arisen which required the interposition of the military or naval power in the controversy which unhappily existed between the people of rhode island .
i was in no manner prevented from so interfering by the inquiry whether rhode island existed as an independent state of the union under a charter granted at an early period by the crown of great britain or not .
it was enough for the executive to know that she was recognized as a sovereign state by great britain by the treaty of 1783 ; that at a later day she had in common with her sister states poured out her blood and freely expended her treasure in the war of the revolution ; that she was a party to the articles of confederation ; that at an after period she adopted the constitution of the united states as a free , independent , and republican state ; and that in this character she has always possessed her full quota of representation in the senate and house of representatives ; and that up to a recent day she has conducted all her domestic affairs and fulfilled all her obligations as a member of the union , in peace and war , under her charter government , as it is denominated by the resolution of the house of the 23d march .
i must be permitted to disclaim entirely and unqualifiedly the right on the part of the executive to make any real or supposed defects existing in any state constitution or form of government the pretext for a failure to enforce the laws or the guaranties of the constitution of the united states in reference to any such state .
i utterly repudiate the idea , in terms as emphatic as i can employ , that those laws are not to be enforced or those guaranties complied with because the president may believe that the right of suffrage or any other great popular right is either too restricted or too broadly enlarged .
i also with equal strength resist the idea that it fails within the executive competency to decide in controversies of the nature of that which existed in rhode island on which side is the majority of the people or as to the extent of the rights of a mere numerical majority .
for the executive to assume such a power would be to assume a power of the most dangerous character .
under such assumptions the states of this union would have no security for peace or tranquillity , but might be converted into the mere instruments of executive will .
actuated by selfish purposes , he might become the great agitator , fomenting assaults upon the state constitutions and declaring the majority of to - day to be the minority of to - morrow , and the minority , in its turn , the majority , before whose decrees the established order of things in the state should be subverted .
revolution , civil commotion , and bloodshed would be the inevitable consequences .
the provision in the constitution intended for the security of the states would thus be turned into the instrument of their destruction .
the president would become , in fact , the great constitution maker for the states , and all power would be vested in his hands .
when , therefore , the governor of rhode island , by his letter of the 4th of april , 1842 , made a requisition upon the executive for aid to put down the late disturbances , i had no hesitation in recognizing the obligations of the executive to furnish such aid upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for by the constitution and laws .
my letter of the 11th of april , in reply to the governor 's letter of the 4th , is herewith communicated , together with all correspondence which passed at a subsequent day and the letters and documents mentioned in the schedule hereunto annexed .
from the correspondence between the executive of the united states and that of rhode island , it will not escape observation that while i regarded it as my duty to announce the principles by which i should govern myself in the contingency of an armed interposition on the part of this government being necessary to uphold the rights of the state of rhode island and to preserve its domestic peace , yet that the strong hope was indulged and expressed that all the difficulties would disappear before an enlightened policy of conciliation and compromise .
in that spirit i addressed to governor king the letter of the 9th of may , 1842 , marked " private and confidential , " and received his reply of the 12th of may of the same year .
the desire of the executive was from the beginning to bring the dispute to a termination without the interposition of the military power of the united states , and it will continue to be a subject of self - congratulation that this leading object of policy was finally accomplished .
the executive resisted all entreaties , however urgent , to depart from this line of conduct .
information from private sources had led the executive to conclude that little else was designed by mr. dorr and his adherents than mere menace with a view to intimidation ; nor was this opinion in any degree shaken until the 22d of june , 1842 , when it was strongly represented from reliable sources , as will be seen by reference to the documents herewith communicated , that preparations were making by mr. dorr , with a large force in arms , to invade the state , which force had been recruited in the neighboring states and had been already preceded by the collection of military stores in considerable quantities at one or two points .
this was a state of things to which the executive could not be indifferent .
mr. dorr speedily afterwards took up his headquarters at chepachet and assumed the command of what was reported to be a large force , drawn chiefly from voluntary enlistments made in neighboring states .
the executive could with difficulty bring itself to realize the fact that the citizens of other states should have forgotten their duty to themselves and the constitution of the united states and have entered into the highly reprehensible and indefensible course of interfering so far in the concerns of a sister state as to have entered into plans of invasion , conquest , and revolution ; but the executive felt it to be its duty to look minutely into the matter , and therefore the secretary of war was dispatched to rhode island with instructions ( a copy of which is herewith transmitted ) , and was authorized , should a requisition be made upon the executive by the government of rhode island in pursuance of law , and the invaders should not abandon their purposes , to call upon the governors of massachusetts and connecticut for a sufficient number of militia at once to arrest the invasion and to interpose such of the regular troops as could be spared from fort adams for the defense of the city of providence in the event of its being attacked , as was strongly represented to be in contemplation .
happily there was no necessity for either issuing the proclamation or the requisition or for removing the troops from fort adams , where they had been properly stationed .
chepachet was evacuated and mr. dorr 's troops dispersed without the necessity of the interposition of any military force by this government , thus confirming me in my early impressions that nothing more had been designed from the first by those associated with mr. dorr than to excite fear and apprehension and thereby to obtain concessions from the constituted authorities which might be claimed as a triumph over the existing government .
with the dispersion of mr. dorr 's troops ended all difficulties .
a convention was shortly afterwards called , by due course of law , to amend the fundamental law , and a new constitution , based on more liberal principles than that abrogated , was proposed , and adopted by the people .
thus the great american experiment of a change in government under the influence of opinion and not of force has been again crowned with success , and the state and people of rhode island repose in safety under institutions of their own adoption , unterrified by any future prospect of necessary change and secure against domestic violence and invasion from abroad .
i congratulate the country upon so happy a termination of a condition of things which seemed at one time seriously to threaten the public peace .
it may justly be regarded as worthy of the age and of the country in which we live .

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states : 
 if any people ever had cause to render up thanks to the supreme being for parental care and protection extended to them in all the trials and difficulties to which they have been from time to time exposed , we certainly are that people .
from the first settlement of our forefathers on this continent , through the dangers attendant upon the occupation of a savage wilderness , through a long period of colonial dependence , through the war of the revolution , in the wisdom which led to the adoption of the existing forms of republican government , in the hazards incident to a war subsequently waged with one of the most powerful nations of the earth , in the increase of our population , in the spread of the arts and sciences , and in the strength and durability conferred on political institutions emanating from the people and sustained by their will , the superintendence of an overruling providence has been plainly visible .
as preparatory , therefore , to entering once more upon the high duties of legislation , it becomes us humbly to acknowledge our dependence upon him as our guide and protector and to implore a continuance of his parental watchfulness over our beloved country .
we have new cause for the expression of our gratitude in the preservation of the health of our fellow - citizens , with some partial and local exceptions , during the past season , for the abundance with which the earth has yielded up its fruits to the labors of the husbandman , for the renewed activity which has been imparted to commerce , for the revival of trade in all its departments , for the increased rewards attendant on the exercise of the mechanic arts , for the continued growth of our population and the rapidly reviving prosperity of the whole country .
i shall be permitted to exchange congratulations with you , gentlemen of the two houses of congress , on these auspicious circumstances , and to assure you in advance of my ready disposition to cur with you in the adoption of all such measures as shall be calculated to increase the happiness of our constituents and to advance the glory of our common country .
since the last adjournment of congress the executive has relaxed no effort to render indestructible the relations of amity which so happily exist between the united states and other countries .
the treaty lately concluded with great britain has tended greatly to increase the good understanding which a reciprocity of interests is calculated to encourage , and it is most ardently to be hoped that nothing may transpire to interrupt the relations of amity which it is so obviously the policy of both nations to cultivate .
a question of much importance still remains to be adjusted between them .
the territorial limits of the two countries relation to what is commonly known as the oregon territory still remain in dispute .
the united states would be at all times indisposed to aggrandize itself at the expense of any other nation ; but while they would be restrained by principles of honor , which should govern the conduct of nations as well as that of individuals , from setting up a demand for territory which does not belong to them , they would as unwillingly sent to a surrender of their rights .
after the most rigid and , as far as practicable , unbiased examination of the subject , the united states have always contended that their rights appertain to the entire region of country lying on the pacific and embraced within 42&deg ; and 54&deg ; 40 ' of north latitude .
this claim being controverted by great britain , those who have preceded the present executive -- actuated , no doubt , by an earnest desire to adjust the matter upon terms mutually satisfactory to both countries -- have caused to be submitted to the british government propositions for settlement and final adjustment , which , however , have not proved heretofore acceptable to it .
our minister at london has , under instructions , again brought the subject to the consideration of that government , and while nothing will be done to compromise the rights or honor of the united states , every proper expedient will be resorted to in order to bring the negotiation now in the progress of resumption to a speedy and happy termination .
in the meantime it is proper to remark that many of our citizens are either already established in the territory or are on their way thither for the purpose of forming permanent settlements , while others are preparing to follow ; and in view of these facts i must repeat the recommendation contained in previous messages for the establishment of military posts at such places on the line of travel as will furnish security and protection to our hardy adventurers against hostile tribes of indians inhabiting those extensive regions .
our laws should also follow them , so modified as the circumstances of the case may seem to require .
under the influence of our free system of government new republics are destined to spring up at no distant day on the shores of the pacific similar in policy and in feeling to those existing on this side of the rocky mountains , and giving a wider and more extensive spread to the principles of civil and religious liberty .
i am happy to inform you that the cases which have from time to time arisen of the detention of american vessels by british cruisers on the coast of africa under pretense of being engaged in the slave trade have been placed in a fair train of adjustment .
in the case of the william and francis full satisfaction will be allowed .
in the cases of the tygris and seamew the british government admits that satisfaction is due .
in the case of the jones the sum accruing from the sale of that vessel and cargo will be paid to the owners , while i can not but flatter myself that full indemnification will be allowed for all damages sustained by the detention of the vessel ; and in the case of the douglas her majesty 's government has expressed its determination to make indemnification .
strong hopes are therefore entertained that most , if not all , of these cases will be speedily adjusted .
no new cases have arisen since the ratification of the treaty of washington , and it is confidently anticipated that the slave trade , under the operation of the eighth article of that treaty , will be altogether suppressed .
the occasional interruption experienced by our fellow - citizens engaged in the fisheries on the neighboring coast of nova scotia has not failed to claim the attention of the executive .
representations upon this subject have been made , but as yet no definitive answer to those representations has been received from the british government .
two other subjects of comparatively minor importance , but nevertheless of too much consequence to be neglected , remain still to be adjusted between the two countries .
by the treaty between the united states and great britain of july , 1815 , it is provided that no higher duties shall be levied in either country on articles imported from the other than on the same articles imported from any other place .
in 1836 rough rice by act of parliament was admitted from the coast of africa into great britain on the payment of a duty of 1 penny a quarter , while the same article from all other countries , including the united states , was subjected to the payment of a duty of 20 shillings a quarter .
our minister at london has from time to time brought this subject to the attention of the british government , but so far without success .
he is instructed to renew his representations upon it .
some years since a claim was preferred against the british government on the part of certain american merchants for the return of export duties paid by them on shipments of woolen goods to the united states after the duty on similar articles exported to other countries had been repealed , and consequently in contravention of the commercial convention between the two nations securing to us equality in such cases .
the principle on which the claim rests has long since been virtually admitted by great britain , but obstacles to a settlement have from time to time been interposed , so that a large portion of the amount claimed has not yet been refunded .
our minister is now engaged in the prosecution of the claim , and i can not but persuade myself that the british government will no longer delay its adjustment .
i am happy to be able to say that nothing has occurred to disturb in any degree the relations of amity which exist between the united states and france , austria , and russia , as well as with the other powers of europe , since the adjournment of congress .
spain has been agitated with internal convulsions for many years , from the effects of which , it is hoped , she is destined speedily to recover , when , under a more liberal system of commercial policy on her part , our trade with her may again fill its old and , so far as her continental possessions are concerned , its almost forsaken channels , thereby adding to the mutual prosperity of the two countries .
the germanic association of customs and commerce , which since its establishment in 1833 has been steadily growing in power and importance , and consists at this time of more than twenty german states , and embraces a population of 27,000,000 people united for all fire purposes of commercial intercourse with each other and with foreign states , offers to the latter the most valuable exchanges on principles more liberal than are offered in the fiscal system of any other european power .
from its origin the importance of the german union has never been lost sight of by the united states .
the industry , morality , and other valuable qualities of the german nation have always been well known and appreciated .
on this subject i invite the attention of congress to the report of the secretary of state , from which it will be seen that while our cotton is admitted free of duty and the duty on rice has been much reduced ( which has already led to a greatly increased consumption ) , a strong disposition has been recently evinced by that great body to reduce , upon certain conditions , their present duty upon tobacco .
this being the first intimation of a concession on this interesting subject ever made by any european power , i can not but regard it as well calculated to remove the only impediment which has so far existed to the most liberal commercial intercourse between us and them .
in this view our minister at berlin , who has heretofore industriously pursued the subject , has been instructed to enter upon the negotiation of a commercial treaty , which , while it will open new advantages to the agricultural interests of the united states and a more free and expanded field for commercial operations , will affect injuriously no existing interest of the union .
should the negotiation be crowned with success , its results will be communicated to both houses of congress .
i communicate herewith certain dispatches received from our minister at mexico , and also a correspondence which has recently occurred between the envoy from that republic and the secretary of state .
it must but be regarded as not a little extraordinary that the government of mexico , in anticipation of a public discussion ( which it has been pleased to infer from newspaper publications as likely to take place in congress , relating to the annexation of texas to the united states ) , should have so far anticipated the result of such discussion as to have announced its determination to visit any such anticipated decision by a formal declaration of war against the united states .
if designed to prevent congress from introducing that question as a fit subject for its calm deliberation and final judgment , the executive has no reason to doubt that it will entirely fail of its object .
the representatives of a brave and patriotic people will suffer no apprehension of future consequences to embarrass them in the course of their proposed deliberations , nor will the executive department of the government fail for any such cause to discharge its whole duty to the country .
the war which has existed for so long a time between mexico and texas has since the battle of san jacinto consisted for the most part of predatory incursions , which , while they have been attended with much of suffering to individuals and have kept the borders of the two countries in a state of constant alarm , have failed to approach to any definitive result .
mexico has fitted out no formidable armament by land or by sea for the subjugation of texas .
eight years have now elapsed since texas declared her independence of mexico , and during that time she has been recognized as a sovereign power by several of the principal civilized states .
mexico , nevertheless , perseveres in her plans of reconquest , and refuses to recognize her independence .
the predatory incursions to which i have alluded have been attended in one instance with the breaking up of the courts of justice , by the seizing upon the persons of the judges , jury , and officers of the court and dragging them along with unarmed , and therefore noncombatant , citizens into a cruel and oppressive bondage , thus leaving crime to go unpunished and immorality to pass unreproved .
a border warfare is evermore to be deprecated , and over such a war as has existed for so many years between these two states humanity has had great cause to lament .
nor is such a condition of things to be deplored only because of the individual suffering attendant upon it .
the effects are far more extensive .
the creator of the universe has given man the earth for his resting place and its fruits for his subsistence .
whatever , therefore , shall make the first or any part of it a scene of desolation affects injuriously his heritage and may be regarded as a general calamity .
wars may sometimes be necessary , but all nations have a common interest in bringing them speedily to a close .
the united states have an immediate interest in seeing an end put to the state of hostilities existing between mexico and texas .
they are our neighbors , of the same continent , with whom we are not only desirous of cultivating the relations of amity , but of the most extended commercial intercourse , and to practice all the rites of a neighborhood hospitality .
our own interests are involved in the matter , since , however neutral may be our course of policy , we can not hope to escape the effects of a spirit of jealousy on the part of both of the powers .
nor can this government be indifferent to the fact that a warfare such as is waged between those two nations is calculated to weaken both powers and finally to render them -- and especially the weaker of the two -- the subjects of interference on the part of stronger and more powerful nations , who , intent only on advancing their own peculiar views , may sooner or later attempt to bring about a compliance with terms as the condition of their interposition alike derogatory to the nation granting them and detrimental to the interests of the united states .
we could not be expected quietly to permit any such interference to our disadvantage .
considering that texas is separated from the united states by a mere geographical line ; that her territory , in the opinion of many , down to a late period formed a portion of the territory of the united states ; that it is homogeneous in its population and pursuits with adjoining states , makes contributions to the commerce of the world in the same articles with them , and that most of her inhabitants have been citizens of the united states , speak the same language , and live under similar political institutions with ourselves , this government is bound by every consideration of interest as well as of sympathy to see that she shall be left free to act , especially in regard to her domestic affairs , unawed by force and unrestrained by the policy or views of other countries .
in full view of all these considerations , the executive has not hesitated to express to the government of mexico how deeply it deprecated a continuance of the war and how anxiously it desired to witness its termination .
i can not but think that it becomes the united states , as the oldest of the american republics , to hold a language to mexico upon this subject of an unambiguous character .
it is time that this war had ceased .
there must be a limit to all wars , and if the parent state after an eight years ' struggle has failed to reduce to submission a portion of its subjects standing out in revolt against it , and who have not only proclaimed themselves to be independent , but have been recognized as such by other powers , she ought not to expect that other nations will quietly look on , to their obvious injury , upon a protraction of hostilities .
these united states threw off their colonial dependence and established independent governments , and great britain , after having wasted her energies in the attempt to subdue them for a less period than mexico has attempted to subjugate texas , had the wisdom and justice to acknowledge their independence , thereby recognizing the obligation which rested on her as one of the family of nations .
an example thus set by one of the proudest as well as most powerful nations of the earth it could in no way disparage mexico to imitate .
while , therefore , the executive would deplore any collision with mexico or any disturbance of the friendly relations which exist between the two countries , it can not permit that government to control its policy , whatever it may be , toward texas , but will treat her -- as by the recognition of her independence the united states have long since declared they would do -- as entirely independent of mexico .
the high obligations of public duty may enforce from the constituted authorities of the united states a policy which the course persevered in by mexico will have mainly contributed to produce , and the executive in such a touting they will with confidence throw itself upon the patriotism of the people to sustain the government in its course of action .
measures of an unusual character have recently been adopted by the mexican government , calculated in no small degree to affect the trade of other nations with mexico and to operate injuriously to the united states .
all foreigners , by a decree of the 23d day of september , and after six months from the day of its promulgation , are forbidden to carry on the business of selling by retail any goods within the confines of mexico .
against this decree our minister has not failed to remonstrate .
the trade heretofore carried on by our citizens with santa fe , in which much capital was already invested and which was becoming of daily increasing importance , has suddenly been arrested by a decree of virtual prohibition on the part of the mexican government .
whatever may be the right of mexico to prohibit any particular course of trade to the citizens or subjects of foreign powers , this late procedure , to say the least of it , wears a harsh and unfriendly aspect .
the installments on the claims recently settled by the convention with mexico have been punctually paid as they have fallen due , and our minister is engaged in urging the establishment of a new commission in pursuance of the convention for the settlement of unadjusted claims .
with the other american states our relations of amity and good will have remained uninterrupted .
our minister near the republic of new granada has succeeded in effecting an adjustment of the claim upon that government for the schooner by chance , which had been pending for many years .
the claim for the brig morris , which had its origin during the existence of the republic of colombia , and indemnification for which since the dissolution of that republic has devolved upon its several members , will be urged with renewed zeal .
i have much pleasure in saying that the government of brazil has adjusted the claim upon that government in the case of the schooner john s. bryan , and that sanguine hopes are entertained that the same spirit of justice will influence its councils in arriving at an early decision upon the remaining claims , thereby removing all cause of dissension between two powers whose interests are to some extent interwoven with each other .
our minister at chili has succeeded in inducing a recognition by that government of the adjustment effected by his predecessor of the first claim in the case of the macedonian .
the first installment has been received by the claimants in the united states .
notice of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty with peru , which will take place at lima , has not yet reached this country , but is shortly expected to be received , when the claims upon that republic will doubtless be liquidated and paid .
in consequence of a misunderstanding between this government and that of buenos ayres , occurring several years ago , this government has remained unrepresented at that court , while a minister from it has been constantly resident here .
the causes of irritation have in a great measure passed away , and it is in contemplation , in view of important interests which have grown up in that country , at some early period during the present session of congress , with the concurrence of the senate , to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries .
under the provisions of an act of congress of the last session a minister was dispatched from the united states to china in august of the present year , who , from the latest accounts we have from him , was at suez , in egypt , on the 25th of september last , on his route to china .
in regard to the indian tribes residing within our jurisdictional limits , the greatest vigilance of the government has been exerted to preserve them at peace among themselves and to inspire them with feelings of confidence in the justice of this government and to cultivate friendship with the border inhabitants .
this has happily succeeded to a great extent , but it is a subject of regret that they suffer themselves in some instances to be imposed upon by artful and designing men and this notwithstanding all efforts of the government to prevent it .
the receipts into the treasury for the calendar year 1843 , exclusive of loans , were little more than $ 18,000,000 , and the expenditures , exclusive of the payments on the public debt , will have been about $ 23,000,000 .
by the act of 1842 a new arrangement of the fiscal year was made , so that it should commence on the 1st day of july in each year .
the accounts and estimates for the current fiscal year will show that the loans and treasury notes made and issued before the close of the last congress to meet the anticipated deficiency have not been entirely adequate .
although on the 1st of october last there was a balance in the treasury , in consequence of the provisions thus made , of $ 3,914,082.77 , yet the appropriations already made by congress will absorb that balance and leave a probable deficiency of $ 2,000,000 at the close of the present fiscal year .
there are outstanding treasury notes to about the amount of $ 4,600,000 , and should they be returned upon the treasury during the fiscal year they will require provision for their redemption .
i do not , however , regard this as probable , since they have obviously entered into the currency of the country and will continue to form a portion of it if the system now adopted be continued .
the loan of 1841 , amounting to $ 5,672,976.88 , falls due on the 1st day of january , 1845 , and must be provided for or postponed by a new loan ; and unless the resources of revenue should be materially increased by you there will be a probable deficiency for the service of the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1845 , of upward of $ 4,000,000 .
the delusion incident to an enormously excessive paper circulation , which gave a fictitious value to everything and stimulated adventure and speculation to an extravagant extent , has been happily succeeded by the substitution of the precious metals and paper promptly redeemable in specie ; and thus false values have disappeared and a sounder condition of things has been introduced .
this transition , although intimately connected with the prosperity of the country , has nevertheless been attended with much embarrassment to the government in its financial concerns .
so long as the foreign importers could receive payment for their cargoes in a currency of greatly less value than that in europe , but fully available here in the purchase of our agricultural productions ( their profits being immeasurably augmented by the operation ) , the shipments were large and the revenues of the government became superabundant .
but the change in the character of the circulation from a nominal and apparently real value in the first stage of its existence to an obviously depreciated value in its second , so that it no longer answered the purposes of exchange or barter , and its ultimate substitution by a sound metallic and paper circulation combined , has been attended by diminished importations and a consequent falling off in the revenue .
this has induced congress , from 1837 , to resort to the expedient of issuing treasury notes , and finally of funding them , in order to supply deficiencies .
i can not , however , withhold the remark that it is in no way compatible with the dignity of the government that a public debt should be created in time of peace to meet the current expenses of the government , or that temporary expedients should be resorted to an hour longer than it is possible to avoid them .
the executive can do no more than apply the means which congress places in its hands for the support of government , and , happily for the good of the country and for the preservation of its liberties , it possesses no power to levy exactions on the people or to force from them contributions to the public revenue in any form .
it can only recommend such measures as may in its opinion be called for by the wants of the public service to congress , with whom alone rests the power to " lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises . "
this duty has upon several occasions heretofore been performed .
the present condition of things gives flattering promise that trade and commerce are rapidly reviving , and , fortunately for the country , the sources of revenue have only to be opened in order to prove abundant .
while we can anticipate no considerable increase in the proceeds of the sales of the public lands , for reasons perfectly obvious to all , for several years to come , yet the public lands can not otherwise than be regarded as the foundation of the public credit .
with so large a body of the most fertile lands in the world under the control and at the disposal of this government , no one can reasonably doubt the entire ability to meet its engagements under every emergency .
in seasons of trial and difficulty similar to those through which we are passing the capitalist makes his investments in the government cut stocks with the most assured confidence of ultimate reimbursement ; and whatever may be said of a period of great financial prosperity , such as existed for some years after 1833 , i should regard it as suicidal in a season of financial embarrassment either to alienate the lands themselves or the proceeds arising from their sales .
the first and paramount duty of those to whom may be intrusted the administration of public affairs is to guard the public credit .
in reestablishing the credit of this central government the readiest and most obvious mode is taken to restore the credit of the states .
the extremities can only be made sound by producing a healthy action in the central government , and the history of the present day fully establishes the fact that an increase in the value of the stocks of this government will in a great majority of instances be attended by an increase in the value of the stocks of the states .
it should therefore be a matter of general congratulation that amidst all the embarrassments arising from surrounding circumstances the credit of the government should have been so fully restored that it has been enabled to effect a loan of $ 7,000,000 to redeem that amount of treasury notes on terms more favorable than any that have been offered for many years .
and the 6 per cent stock which was created in 1842 has advanced in the hands of the holders nearly 20 per cent above its par value .
the confidence of the people in the integrity of their government has thus been signally manifested .
these opinions relative to the public lands do not in any manner conflict with the observance of the most liberal policy toward those of our fellow - citizens who press forward into the wilderness and are the pioneers in the work of its reclamation .
in securing to all such their rights of preemption the government performs but an act of retributive justice for sufferings encountered and hardships endured , and finds ample remuneration in the comforts which its policy insures and the happiness which it imparts .
should a revision of the tariff with a view to revenue become necessary in the estimation of congress , i doubt not you will approach the subject with a just and enlightened regard to the interests of the whole union .
the principles and views which i have heretofore had occasion to submit remain unchanged .
it can , however , never be too often repeated that the prominent interest of every important pursuit of life requires for success permanency and stability in legislation .
these can only be attained by adopting as the basis of action moderation in all things , which is as indispensably necessary to secure the harmonious action of the political as of the animal system .
in our political organization no one section of the country should desire to have its supposed interests advanced at the sacrifice of all others , but union , being the great interest , equally precious to all , should be fostered and sustained by mutual concessions and the cultivation of that spirit of compromise from which the constitution itself proceeded .
you will be informed by the report from the treasury department of the measures taken under the act of the last session authorizing the reissue of treasury notes in lieu of those then outstanding .
the system adopted in pursuance of existing laws seems well calculated to save the country a large amount of interest , while it affords conveniences and obviates dangers and expense in the transmission of funds to disbursing agents .
i refer you also to that report for the means proposed by the secretary to increase the revenue , and particularly to that portion of it which relates to the subject of the warehousing system , which i earnestly urged upon congress at its last session and as to the importance of which my opinion has undergone no change .
in view of the disordered condition of the currency at the time and the high rates of exchange between different parts of the country , i felt it to be incumbent on me to present to the consideration of your predecessors a proposition conflicting in no degree with the constitution or with the rights of the states and having the sanction ( not in detail , but in principle ) of some of the eminent men who have preceded me in the executive office .
that proposition contemplated the issuing of treasury notes of denominations of not less than $ 5 nor more than $ 100 , to be employed in the payment of the obligations of the government in lieu of gold and silver at the option of the public creditor , and to an amount not exceeding $ 15,000,000 .
it was proposed to make them receivable everywhere and to establish at various points depositories of gold and silver to be held in trust for the redemption of such notes , so as to insure their convertibility into specie .
no doubt was entertained that such notes would have maintained a par value with gold and silver , thus furnishing a paper currency of equal value over the union , thereby meeting the just expectations of the people and fulfilling the duties of a parental government .
whether the depositories should be permitted to sell or purchase bills under very limited restrictions , together with all its other details , was submitted to the wisdom of congress and was regarded as of secondary importance .
i thought then and think now that such an arrangement would have been attended with the happiest results .
the whole matter of the currency would have been placed where by the constitution it was designed to be placed -- under the immediate supervision and control of congress .
the action of the government would have been independent of all corporations , and the same eye which rests unceasingly on the specie currency and guards it against adulteration would also have rested on the paper currency , to control and regulate its issues and protect it against depreciation .
the same reasons which would forbid congress from parting with the power over the coinage would seem to operate with nearly equal force hi regard to any substitution for the precious metals in the form of a circulating medium .
paper when substituted for specie constitutes a standard of value by which the operations of society are regulated , and whatsoever causes its depreciation affects society to an extent nearly , if not quite , equal to the adulteration of the coin .
nor can i withhold the remark that its advantages contrasted with a bank of the united states , apart from the fact that a bank was esteemed as obnoxious to the public sentiment as well on the score of expediency as of constitutionality , appeared to me to be striking and obvious .
the relief which a bank would afford by an issue of $ 15,000,000 of its notes , judging from the experience of the late united states bank , would not have occurred in less than fifteen years , whereas under the proposed arrangement the relief arising from the issue of $ 15,000,000 of treasury notes would have been consummated in one year , thus furnishing in one - fifteenth part of the time in which a bank could have accomplished it a paper medium of exchange equal in amount to the real wants of the country at par value with gold and silver .
the saving to the government would have been equal to all the interest which it has had to pay on treasury notes of previous as well as subsequent issues , thereby relieving the government and at the same time affording relief to the people .
under all the responsibilities attached to the station which i occupy , and in redemption of a pledge given to the last congress at the close of its first session , i submitted the suggestion to its consideration at two consecutive sessions .
the recommendation , however , met with no favor at its hands .
while i am free to admit that the necessities of the times have since become greatly ameliorated and that there is good reason to hope that the country is safely and rapidly emerging from the difficulties and embarrassments which everywhere surrounded it in 1841 , yet i can not but think that its restoration to a sound and healthy condition would be greatly expedited by a resort to the expedient in a modified form .
the operations of the treasury now rest upon the act of 1789 and the resolution of 1816 , and those laws have been so administered as to produce as great a quantum of good to the country as their provisions are capable of yielding .
if there had been any distinct expression of opinion going to show that public sentiment is averse to the plan , either as heretofore recommended to congress or in a modified form , while my own opinion in regard to it would remain unchanged i should be very far from again presenting it to your consideration .
the government has originated with the states and the people , for their own benefit and advantage , and it would be subversive of the foundation principles of the political edifice which they have reared to persevere in a measure which in their mature judgments they had either repudiated or condemned .
the will of our constituents clearly expressed should be regarded as the light to guide our footsteps , the true difference between a monarchical or aristocratical government and a republic being that in the first the will of the few prevails over the will of the many , while in the last the will of the many should be alone consulted .
the report of the secretary of war will bring you acquainted with the condition of that important branch of the public service .
the army may be regarded , in consequence of the small number of the rank and file in each company and regiment , as little more than a nucleus around which to rally the military force of the country in case of war , and yet its services in preserving the peace of the frontiers are of a most important nature .
in all cases of emergency the reliance of the country is properly placed in the militia of the several states , and it may well deserve the consideration of congress whether a new and more perfect organization might not be introduced , looking mainly to the volunteer companies of the union for the present and of easy application to the great body of the militia in time of war .
the expenditures of the war department have been considerably reduced in the last two years .
contingencies , however , may arise which would call for the filling up of the regiments with a full complement of men and make it very desirable to remount the corps of dragoons , which by an act of the last congress was directed to be dissolved .
i refer you to the accompanying report of the secretary for information in relation to the navy of the united states .
while every effort has been and will continue to be made to retrench all superfluities and lop off all excrescences which from time to time may have grown up , yet it has not been regarded as wise or prudent to recommend any material change in the annual appropriations .
the interests which are involved are of too important a character to lead to the recommendation of any other than a liberal policy .
adequate appropriations ought to be made to enable the executive to fit out all the ships that are now in a course of building or that require repairs for active service in the shortest possible time should any emergency arise which may require it .
an efficient navy , while it is the cheapest means of public defense , enlists in its support the feelings of pride and confidence which brilliant deeds and heroic valor have heretofore served to strengthen and confirm .
i refer you particularly to that part of the secretary 's report which has reference to recent experiments in the application of steam and in the construction of our war steamers , made under the superintendence of distinguished officers of the navy .
in addition to other manifest improvements in the construction of the steam engine and application of the motive power which has rendered them more appropriate to the uses of ships of war , one of those officers has brought into use a power which makes the steamship most formidable either for attack or defense .
i can not too strongly recommend this subject to your consideration and do not hesitate to express my entire conviction of its great importance .
i call your particular attention also to that portion of the secretary 's report which has reference to the act of the late session of congress which prohibited the transfer of any balance of appropriation from other heads of appropriation to that for building , equipment , and repair .
the repeal of that prohibition will enable the department to give renewed employment to a large class of workmen who have been necessarily discharged in consequence of the want of means to pay them -- a circumstance attended , especially at this season of the year , with much privation and suffering .
it gives me great pain to announce to you the loss of the steamship the missouri by fire in the bay of gibraltar , where she had stopped to renew her supplies of coal on her voyage to alexandria , with mr. cushing , the american minister to china , on board .
there is ground for high commendation of the officers and men for the coolness and intrepidity and perfect submission to discipline evinced under the most trying circumstances .
surrounded by a raging fire , which the utmost exertions could not subdue , and which threatened momentarily the explosion of her well - supplied magazines , the officers exhibited no signs of fear and the men obeyed every order with alacrity .
nor was she abandoned until the last gleam of hope of saving her had expired .
it is well worthy of your consideration whether the losses sustained by the officers and crew in this unfortunate affair should not be reimbursed to them .
i can not take leave of this painful subject without adverting to the aid rendered upon the occasion by the british authorities at gibraltar and the commander , officers , and crew of the british ship of the line the malabar , which was lying at the time in the bay .
everything that generosity or humanity could dictate was promptly performed .
it is by such acts of good will by one to another of the family of nations that fraternal feelings are nourished and the blessings of permanent peace secured .
the report of the postmaster - general will bring you acquainted with the operations of that department during the past year , and will suggest to you such modifications of the existing laws as in your opinion the exigencies of the public service may require .
the change which the country has undergone of late years in the mode of travel and transportation has afforded so many facilities for the transmission of mail matter out of the regular mail as to require the greatest vigilance and circumspection in order to enable the officer at the head of the department to restrain the expenditures within the income .
there is also too much reason to fear that the franking privilege has run into great abuse .
the department , nevertheless , has been conducted with the greatest vigor , and has attained at the least possible expense all the useful objects for which it was established .
in regard to all the departments , i am quite happy in the belief that nothing has been left undone which was called for by a true spirit of economy or by a system of accountability rigidly enforced .
this is in some degree apparent from the fact that the government has sustained no loss by the default of any of its agents .
in the complex , but at the same time beautiful , machinery of our system of government , it is not a matter of surprise that some remote agency may have failed for an instant to fulfill its desired office ; but i feel confident in the assertion that nothing has occurred to interrupt the harmonious action of the government itself , and that , while the laws have been executed with efficiency and vigor , the rights neither of states nor individuals have been trampled on or disregarded .
in the meantime the country has been steadily advancing in all that contributes to national greatness .
the tide of population continues unbrokenly to flow into the new states and territories , where a refuge is found not only for our native - born fellow - citizens , but for emigrants from all parts of the civilized world , who come among us to partake of the blessings of our free institutions and to aid by their labor to swell the current of our wealth and power .
it is due to every consideration of public policy that the lakes and rivers of the west should receive all such attention at the hands of congress as the constitution will enable it to bestow .
works in favorable and proper situations on the lakes would be found to be as indispensably necessary , in case of war , to carry on safe and successful naval operations as fortifications on the atlantic seaboard .
the appropriation made by the last congress for the improvement of the navigation of the mississippi river has been diligently and efficiently applied .
i can not close this communication , gentlemen , without recommending to your most favorable consideration the interests of this district .
appointed by the constitution its exclusive legislators , and forming in this particular the only anomaly in our system of government -- of the legislative body being elected by others than those for whose advantage they are to legislate -- you will feel a superadded obligation to look well into their condition and to leave no cause for complaint or regret .
the seat of government of our associated republics can not but be regarded as worthy of your parental care .
in connection with its other interests , as well as those of the whole country , i recommend that at your present session you adopt such measures in order to carry into effect the smithsonian bequest as in your judgment will be best calculated to consummate the liberal intent of the testator .
when , under a dispensation of divine providence , i succeeded to the presidential office , the state of public affairs was embarrassing and critical .
to add to the irritation consequent upon a long - standing controversy with one of the most powerful nations of modern times , involving not only questions of boundary ( which under the most favorable circumstances are always embarrassing ) , but at the same time important and high principles of maritime law , border controversies between the citizens and subjects of the two countries had engendered a state of feeling and of conduct which threatened the most calamitous consequences .
the hazards incident to this state of things were greatly heightened by the arrest and imprisonment of a subject of great britain , who , acting ( as it was alleged ) as a part of a military force , had aided in the commission of an act violative of the territorial jurisdiction of the united states and involving the murder of a citizen , of the state of new york .
a large amount of claims against the government of mexico remained unadjusted and a war of several years ' continuance with the savage tribes of florida still prevailed , attended with the desolation of a large portion of that beautiful territory and with the sacrifice of many valuable lives .
to increase the embarrassments of the government , individual and state credit had been nearly stricken down and confidence in the general government was so much impaired that - loans of a small amount could only be negotiated at a considerable sacrifice .
as a necessary consequence of the blight which had fallen on commerce and mechanical industry , the ships of the one were thrown out of employment and the operations of the other had been greatly diminished .
owing to the condition of the currency , exchanges between different parts of the country had become ruinously high and trade had to depend on a depreciated paper currency in conducting its transactions .
i shall be permitted to congratulate the country that under an overruling providence peace was preserved without a sacrifice of the national honor ; the war in florida was brought to a speedy termination ; a large portion of the claims on mexico have been fully adjudicated and are in a course of payment , while justice has been rendered to us in other matters by other nations ; confidence between man and man is in a great measure restored and the credit of this government fully and perfectly reestablished ; commerce is becoming more and more extended in its operations and manufacturing and mechanical industry once more reap the rewards of skill and labor honestly applied ; the operations of trade rest on a sound currency and the rates of exchange are reduced to their lowest amount .
in this condition of things i have felt it to be my duty to bring to your favorable consideration matters of great interest in their present and ultimate results ; and the only desire which i feel in connection with the future is and will continue to be to leave the country prosperous and its institutions unimpaired .

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states : 
 we have continued cause for expressing our gratitude to the supreme ruler of the universe for the benefits and blessings which our country , under his kind providence , has enjoyed during the past year .
notwithstanding the exciting scenes through which we have passed , nothing has occurred to disturb the general peace or to derange the harmony of our political system .
the great moral spectacle has been exhibited of a nation approximating in number to 20,000,000 people having performed the high and important function of electing their chief magistrate for the term of four years without the commission of any acts of violence or the manifestation of a spirit of insubordination to the laws .
the great and inestimable right of suffrage has been exercised by all who were invested with it under the laws of the different states in a spirit dictated alone by a desire , in the selection of the agent , to advance the interests of the country and to place beyond jeopardy the institutions under which it is our happiness to live .
that the deepest interest has been manifested by all our countrymen in the result of the election is not less true than highly creditable to them .
vast multitudes have assembled from time to time at various places for the purpose of canvassing the merits and pretensions of those who were presented for their suffrages , but no armed soldiery has been necessary to restrain within proper limits the popular zeal or to prevent violent outbreaks .
a principle much more controlling was found in the love of order and obedience to the laws , which , with mere individual exceptions , everywhere possesses the american mind , and controls with an influence far more powerful than hosts of armed men .
we can not dwell upon this picture without recognizing in it that deep and devoted attachment on the part of the people to the institutions under which we live which proclaims their perpetuity .
the great objection which has always prevailed against the election by the people of their chief executive officer has been the apprehension of tumults and disorders which might involve in ruin the entire government .
a security against this is found not only in the fact before alluded to , but in the additional fact that we live under a confederacy embracing already twenty - six states , no one of which has power to control the election .
the popular vote in each state is taken at the time appointed by the laws , and such vote is announced by the electoral college without reference to the decision of other states .
the right of suffrage and the mode of conducting the election are regulated by the laws of each state , and the election is distinctly federative in all its prominent features .
thus it is that , unlike what might be the results under a consolidated system , riotous proceedings , should they prevail , could only affect the elections in single states without disturbing to any dangerous extent the tranquillity of others .
the great experiment of a political confederation each member of which is supreme as to all matters appertaining to its local interests and its internal peace and happiness , while by a voluntary compact with others it confides to the united power of all the protection of its citizens in matters not domestic has been so far crowned with complete success .
the world has witnessed its rapid growth in wealth and population , and under the guide and direction of a superintending providence the developments of the past may be regarded but as the shadowing forth of the mighty future .
in the bright prospects of that future we shall find , as patriots and philanthropists , the highest inducements to cultivate and cherish a love of union and to frown down every measure or effort which may be made to alienate the states or the people of the states in sentiment and feeling from each other .
a rigid and close adherence to the terms of our political compact and , above all , a sacred observance of the guaranties of the constitution will preserve union on a foundation which can not be shaken , while personal liberty is placed beyond hazard or jeopardy .
the guaranty of religious freedom , of the freedom of the press , of the liberty of speech , of the trial by jury , of the habeas corpus , and of the domestic institutions of each of the states , leaving the private citizen in the full exercise of the high and ennobling attributes of his nature and to each state the privilege ( which can only be judiciously exerted by itself ) of consulting the means best calculated to advance its own happiness -- these are the great and important guaranties of the constitution which the lovers of liberty must cherish and the advocates of union must ever cultivate .
preserving these and avoiding all interpolations by forced construction under the guise of an imagined expediency upon the constitution , the influence of our political system is destined to be as actively and as beneficially felt on the distant shores of the pacific as it is now on those of the atlantic ocean .
the only formidable impediments in the way of its successful expansion ( time and space ) are so far in the progress of modification by the improvements of the age as to render no longer speculative the ability of representatives from that remote region to come up to the capitol , so that their constituents shall participate in all the benefits of federal legislation .
thus it is that in the progress of time the inestimable principles of civil liberty will be enjoyed by millions yet unborn and the great benefits of our system of government be extended to now distant and uninhabited regions .
in view of the vast wilderness yet to be reclaimed , we may well invite the lover of freedom of every land to take up his abode among us and assist us in the great work of advancing the standard of civilization and giving a wider spread to the arts and refinements of cultivated life .
our prayers should evermore be offered up to the father of the universe for his wisdom to direct us in the path of our duty so as to enable us to consummate these high purposes .
one of the strongest objections which has been urged against confederacies by writers on government is the liability of the members to be tampered with by foreign governments or the people of foreign states , either in their local affairs or in such as affected the peace of others or endangered the safety of the whole confederacy .
we can not hope to be entirely exempt from such attempts on our peace and safety .
the united states are becoming too important in population and resources not to attract the observation of other nations .
it therefore may in the progress of time occur that opinions entirely abstract in the states which they may prevail and in no degree affecting their domestic institutions may be artfully but secretly encouraged with a view to undermine the union .
such opinions may become the foundation of political parties , until at last the conflict of opinion , producing an alienation of friendly feeling among the people of the different states , may involve in general destruction the happy institutions under which we live .
it should ever be borne in mind that what is true in regard to individuals is equally so in regard to states .
an interference of one in the affairs of another is the fruitful cause of family dissensions and neighborhood disputes , and the same cause affects the peace , happiness , and prosperity of states .
it may be most devoutly hoped that the good sense of the american people will ever be ready to repel all such attempts should they ever be made .
there has been no material change in our foreign relations since my last annual message to congress .
with all the powers of europe we continue on the most friendly terms .
indeed , it affords me much satisfaction to state that at no former period has the peace of that enlightened and important quarter of the globe ever been , apparently , more firmly established .
the conviction that peace is the true policy of nations would seem to be growing and becoming deeper amongst the enlightened everywhere , and there is no people who have a stronger interest in cherishing the sentiments and adopting the means of preserving and giving it permanence than those of the united states .
amongst these , the first and most effective are , no doubt , the strict observance of justice and the honest and punctual fulfillment of all engagements .
but it is not to be forgotten that in the present state of the world it is no less necessary to be ready to enforce their observance and fulfillment in reference to ourselves than to observe and fulfill them on our part in regard to others .
since the close of your last session a negotiation has been formally entered upon between the secretary of state and her britannic majesty 's minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary residing at washington relative to the rights of their respective nations in and over the oregon territory .
that negotiation is still pending .
should it during your session be brought to a definitive conclusion , the result will be promptly communicated to congress .
i would , however , again call your attention to the recommendations contained in previous messages designed to protect and facilitate emigration to that territory .
the establishment of military posts at suitable points upon the extended line of land travel would enable our citizens to emigrate in comparative safety to the fertile regions below the falls of the columbia , and make the provision of the existing convention for the joint occupation of the territory by subjects of great britain and the citizens of the united states more available than heretofore to the latter .
these posts would constitute places of rest for the weary emigrant , where he would be sheltered securely against the danger of attack from the indians and be enabled to recover from the exhaustion of a long line of travel .
legislative enactments should also be made which should spread over him the aegis of our laws , so as to afford protection to his person and property when he shall have reached his distant home .
in this latter respect the british government has been much more careful of the interests of such of her people as are to be found in that country than the united states .
she has made necessary provision for their security and protection against the acts of the viciously disposed and lawless , and her emigrant reposes in safety under the panoply of her laws .
whatever may be the result of the pending negotiation , such measures are necessary .
it will afford me the greatest pleasure to witness a happy and favorable termination to the existing negotiation upon terms compatible with the public honor , and the best efforts of the government will continue to be directed to this end .
it would have given me the highest gratification in this my last annual communication to congress to have been able to announce to you the complete and entire settlement and adjustment of other matters in difference between the united states and the government of her britannic majesty , which were adverted to in a previous message .
it is so obviously the interest of both countries , in respect to the large and valuable commerce which exists between them , that all causes of complaint , however inconsiderable , should be with the greatest promptitude removed that it must be regarded as cause of regret that any unnecessary delays should be permitted to intervene .
it is true that in a pecuniary point of view the matters alluded to are altogether insignificant in amount when compared with the ample resources of that great nation , but they nevertheless , more particularly that limited class which arise under seizures and detentions of american ships on the coast of africa upon the mistaken supposition indulged in at the time the wrong was committed of their being engaged in the slave trade , deeply affect the sensibilities of this government and people .
great britain , having recognized her responsibility to repair all such wrongs by her action in other cases , leaves nothing to be regretted upon the subject and to all cases arising prior to the treaty of washington than the delay in making suitable reparation in such of them as fall plainly within the principle of others which she has long since adjusted .
the injury inflicted by delays in the settlement of these claims falls with severity upon the individual claimants and makes a strong appeal to her magnanimity and sense of justice for a speedy settlement .
other matters arising out of the construction of existing treaties also remain unadjusted , and will continue to be urged upon her attention .
the labors of the joint commission appointed by the two governments to run the dividing line established by the treaty of washington were , unfortunately , much delayed in the commencement of the season by the failure of congress at its last session to make a timely appropriation of funds to meet the expenses of the american party , and by other causes .
the united states commissioner , however , expresses his expectation that by increased diligence and energy the party will be able to make up for lost time .
we continue to receive assurances of the most friendly feelings on the part of all the other european powers , with each and all of whom it is so obviously our interest to cultivate the most amicable relations ; nor can i anticipate the occurrence of any event which would be likely in any degree to disturb those relations .
russia , the great northern power , under the judicious sway of her emperor , is constantly advancing in the road of science and improvement , while france , guided by the counsels of her wise sovereign , pursues a course calculated to consolidate the general peace .
spain has obtained a breathing spell of some duration from the internal convulsions which have through so many years marred her prosperity , while austria , the netherlands , prussia , belgium , and the other powers of europe reap a rich harvest of blessings from the prevailing peace .
i informed the two houses of congress in my message of december last that instructions had been given to mr. wheaton , our minister at berlin , to negotiate a treaty with the germanic states composing the zollverein if it could be done , stipulating , as far as it was practicable to accomplish it , for a reduction of the heavy and onerous duties levied on our tobacco and other leading articles of agricultural production , and yielding in return on our part a reduction of duties on such articles the product of their industry as should not come into competition , or but a limited one , with articles the product of our manufacturing industry .
the executive in giving such instructions considered itself as acting in strict conformity with the wishes of congress as made known through several measures which it had adopted , all directed to the accomplishment of this important result .
the treaty was therefore negotiated , by which essential reductions were secured in the duties levied by the zollverein on tobacco , rice , and lard , accompanied by a stipulation for the admission of raw cotton free of duty ; in exchange for which highly important concessions a reduction of duties imposed by the laws of the united states on a variety of articles , most of which were admitted free of all duty under the act of congress commonly known as the compromise law , and but few of which were produced in the united states , was stipulated for on our part .
this treaty was communicated to the senate at an early day of its last session , but not acted upon until near its close , when , for the want ( as i am bound to presume ) of full time to consider it , it was laid upon the table .
this procedure had the effect of virtually rejecting it , in consequence of a stipulation contained in the treaty that its ratifications should be exchanged on or before a day which has already passed .
the executive , acting upon the fair inference that the senate did not intend its absolute rejection , gave instructions to our minister at berlin to reopen the negotiation so far as to obtain an extension of time for the exchange of ratifications .
i regret , however , to say that his , efforts in this respect have been unsuccessful .
i am nevertheless not without hope that the great advantages which were intended to be secured by the treaty may yet be realized .
i am happy to inform you that belgium has , by an " arrete royale " issued in july last , assimilated the flag of the united states to her own , so far as the direct trade between the two countries is concerned .
this measure will prove of great service to our shipping interest , the trade having heretofore been carried on chiefly in foreign bottoms .
i flatter myself that she will speedily resort to a modification of her system relating to the tobacco trade , which would decidedly benefit the agriculture of the united states and operate to the mutual advantage of both countries .
no definitive intelligence has yet been received from our minister of the conclusion of a treaty with the chinese empire , but enough is known to induce the strongest hopes that the mission will be crowned with success .
with brazil our relations continue on the most friendly footing .
the commercial intercourse between that growing empire and the united states is becoming daily of greater importance to both , and it is to the interest of both that the firmest relations of amity and good will should continue to be cultivated between them .
the republic of new granada still withholds , notwithstanding the most persevering efforts have been employed by our charge d'affaires , mr. blackford , to produce a different result , indemnity in the case of the brig morris ; and the congress of venezuela , although an arrangement has been effected between our minister and the minister of foreign affairs of that government for the payment of $ 18,000 in discharge of its liabilities in the same case , has altogether neglected to make provision for its payment .
it is to be hoped that a sense of justice will soon induce a settlement of these claims .
our late minister to chili , mr. pendleton , has returned to the united states without having effected an adjustment in the second claim of the macedonian , which is delayed on grounds altogether frivolous and untenable .
mr. pendleton 's successor has been directed to urge the claim in the strongest terms , and , in the event of a failure to obtain a prompt adjustment , to report the fact to the executive at as early a day as possible , so that the whole matter may be communicated to congress .
at your last session i submitted to the attention of congress the convention with the republic of peru of the 17th march , 1841 , providing for the adjustment of the claims of citizens of the united states against that republic , but no definitive action was taken upon the subject .
i again invite to it your attention and prompt action .
in my last annual message i felt it to be my duty to make known to congress , in terms both plain and emphatic , my opinion in regard to the war which has so long existed between mexico and texas which since the battle of san jacinto has consisted altogether of predatory incursions , attended by circumstances revolting to humanity .
i repeat now what i then said , that after eight years of feeble and ineffectual efforts to reconquer texas it was time that the war should have ceased .
the united states have a direct interest in the question .
the contiguity of the two nations to our territory was but too well calculated to involve our peace .
unjust suspicions were engendered in the mind of one or the other of the belligerents against us , and as a necessary consequence american interests were made to suffer and our peace became daily endangered ; in addition to which it must have been obvious to all that the exhaustion produced by the war subjected both mexico and texas to the interference of other powers , which , without the interposition of this government , might eventuate in the most serious injury to the united states .
this government from time to time exerted its friendly offices to bring about a termination of hostilities upon terms honorable alike to both the belligerents .
its efforts in this behalf proved unavailing .
mexico seemed almost without an object to persevere in the war , and no other alternative was left the executive but to take advantage of the well - known dispositions of texas and to invite her to enter into a treaty for annexing her territory to that of the united states .
since your last session mexico has threatened to renew the war , and has either made or proposes to make formidable preparations for invading texas .
she has issued decrees and proclamations , preparatory to the commencement of hostilities , full of threats revolting to humanity , and which if carried into effect would arouse the attention of all christendom .
this new demonstration of feeling , there is too much reason to believe , has been produced in consequence of the negotiation of the late treaty of annexation with texas .
the executive , therefore , could not be indifferent to such proceedings , and it felt it to be due as well to itself as to the honor of the country that a strong representation should be made to the mexican government upon the subject .
this was accordingly done , as will be seen by the copy of the accompanying dispatch from the secretary of state to the united states envoy at mexico .
mexico has no right to jeopard the peace of the world by urging any longer a useless and fruitless contest .
such a condition of things would not be tolerated on the european continent .
why should it be on this ?
a war of desolation , such as is now threatened by mexico , can not be waged without involving our peace and tranquillity .
it is idle to believe that such a war could be looked upon with indifference by our own citizens inhabiting adjoining states ; and our neutrality would be violated in despite of all efforts on the part of the government to prevent it .
the country is settled by emigrants from the united states under invitations held out to them by spain and mexico .
those emigrants have left behind them friends and relatives , who would not fail to sympathize with them in their difficulties , and who would be led by those sympathies to participate in their struggles , however energetic the action of the government to prevent it .
nor would the numerous and formidable bands of indians -- the most warlike to be found in any land -- which occupy the extensive regions contiguous to the states of arkansas and missouri , and who are in possession of large tracts of country within the limits of texas , be likely to remain passive .
the inclinations of those numerous tribes lead them invariably to war whenever pretexts exist .
mexico had no just ground of displeasure against this government or people for negotiating the treaty .
what interest of hers was affected by the treaty ?
she was despoiled of nothing , since texas was forever lost to her .
the independence of texas was recognized by several of the leading powers of the earth .
she was free to treat , free to adopt her own line of policy , free to take the course which she believed was best calculated to secure her happiness .
her government and people decided on annexation to the united states , and the executive saw in the acquisition of such a territory the means of advancing their permanent happiness and glory .
what principle of good faith , then , was violated ?
what rule of political morals trampled under foot ?
so far as mexico herself was concerned , the measure should have been regarded by her as highly beneficial .
her inability to reconquer texas had been exhibited , i repeat , by eight ( now nine ) years of fruitless and ruinous contest .
in the meantime texas has been growing in population and resources .
emigration has flowed into her territory from all parts of the world in a current which continues to increase in strength .
mexico requires a permanent boundary between that young republic and herself .
texas at no distant day , if she continues separate and detached from the united states , will inevitably seek to consolidate her strength by adding to her domain the contiguous provinces of mexico .
the spirit of revolt from the control of the central government has heretofore manifested itself in some of those provinces , and it is fair to infer that they would be inclined to take the first favorable opportunity to proclaim their independence and to form close alliances with texas .
the war would thus be endless , or if cessations of hostilities should occur they would only endure for a season .
the interests of mexico , therefore , could in nothing be better consulted than in a peace with her neighbors which would result in the establishment of a permanent boundary .
upon the ratification of the treaty the executive was prepared to treat with her on the most liberal basis .
hence the boundaries of texas were left undefined by the treaty .
the executive proposed to settle these upon terms that all the world should have pronounced just and reasonable .
no negotiation upon that point could have been undertaken between the united states and mexico in advance of the ratification of the treaty .
we should have had no right , no power , no authority , to have conducted such a negotiation , and to have undertaken it would have been an assumption equally revolting to the pride of mexico and texas and subjecting us to the charge of arrogance , while to have proposed in advance of annexation to satisfy mexico for any contingent interest she might have in texas would have been to have treated texas not as an independent power , but as a mere dependency of mexico .
this assumption could not have been acted on by the executive without setting at defiance your own solemn declaration that that republic was an independent state .
mexico had , it is true , threatened war against the united states in the event the treaty of annexation was ratified .
the executive could not permit itself to be influenced by this threat .
it represented in this the spirit of our people , who are ready to sacrifice much for peace , but nothing to intimidation .
a war under any circumstances is greatly to be deplored , and the united states is the last nation to desire it ; but if , as the condition of peace , it be required of us to forego the unquestionable right of treating with an independent power of our own continent upon matters highly interesting to both , and that upon a naked and unsustained pretension of claim by a third power to control the free will of the power with whom we treat , devoted as we may be to peace and anxious to cultivate friendly relations with the whole world , the executive does not hesitate to say that the people of the united states would be ready to brave all consequences sooner than submit to such condition .
but no apprehension of war was entertained by the executive , and i must express frankly the opinion that had the treaty been ratified by the senate it would have been followed by a prompt settlement , to the entire satisfaction of mexico , of every matter in difference between the two countries .
seeing , then , that new preparations for hostile invasion of texas were about to be adopted by mexico , and that these were brought about because texas had adopted the suggestions of the executive upon the subject of annexation , it could not passively have folded its arms and permitted a war , threatened to be accompanied by every act that could mark a barbarous age , to be waged against her because she had done so .
other considerations of a controlling character influenced the course of the executive .
the treaty which had thus been negotiated had failed to receive the ratification of the senate .
one of the chief objections which was urged against it was found to consist in the fact that the question of annexation had not been submitted to the ordeal of public opinion in the united states .
however untenable such an objection was esteemed to be , in view of the unquestionable power of the executive to negotiate the treaty and the great and lasting interests involved in the question , i felt it to be my duty to submit the whole subject to congress as the best expounders of popular sentiment .
no definitive action having been taken on the subject by congress , the question referred itself directly to the decision of the states and people .
the great popular election which has just terminated afforded the best opportunity of ascertaining the will of the states and the people upon it .
pending that issue it became the imperative duty of the executive to inform mexico that the question of annexation was still before the american people , and that until their decision was pronounced any serious invasion of texas would be regarded as an attempt to forestall their judgment and could not be looked upon with indifference .
i am most happy to inform you that no such invasion has taken place ; and i trust that whatever your action may be upon it mexico will see the importance of deciding the matter by a resort to peaceful expedients in preference to those of arms .
the decision of the people and the states on this great and interesting subject has been decisively manifested .
the question of annexation has been presented nakedly to their consideration .
by the treaty itself all collateral and incidental issues which were calculated to divide and distract the public councils were carefully avoided .
these were left to the wisdom of the future to determine .
it presented , i repeat , the isolated question of annexation , and in that form it has been submitted to the ordeal of public sentiment .
a controlling majority of the people and a large majority of the states have declared in favor of immediate annexation .
instructions have thus come up to both branches of congress from their respective constituents in terms the most emphatic .
it is the will of both the people and the states that texas shall be annexed to the union promptly and immediately .
it may be hoped that in carrying into execution the public will thus declared all collateral issues may be avoided .
future legislatures can best decide as to the number of states which should be formed out of the territory when the time has arrived for deciding that question .
so with all others .
by the treaty the united states assumed the payment of the debts of texas to an amount not exceeding $ 10,000,000 , to be paid , with the exception of a sum falling short of $ 400,000 , exclusively out of the proceeds of the sales of her public lands .
we could not with honor take the lands without assuming the full payment of all incumbencies upon them .
nothing has occurred since your last session to induce a doubt that the dispositions of texas remain unaltered .
no intimation of an altered determination on the part of her government and people has been furnished to the executive .
she still desires to throw herself under the protection of our laws and to partake of the blessings of our federative system , while every american interest would seem to require it .
the extension of our coastwise and foreign trade to an amount almost incalculable , the enlargement of the market for our manufactures , a constantly growing market for our agricultural productions , safety to our frontiers , and additional strength and stability to the union -- these are the results which would rapidly develop themselves upon the consummation of the measure of annexation .
in such event i will not doubt but that mexico would find her true interest to consist in meeting the advances of this government in a spirit of amity .
nor do i apprehend any serious complaint from any other quarter ; no sufficient ground exists for such complaint .
we should interfere in no respect with the rights of any other nation .
there can not be gathered from the act any design on our part to do so with their possessions on this continent .
we have interposed no impediments in the way of such acquisitions of territory , large and extensive as many of them are , as the leading powers of europe have made from time to time in every part of the world .
we seek no conquest made by war .
no intrigue will have been resorted to or acts of diplomacy essayed to accomplish the annexation of texas .
free and independent herself , she asks to be received into our union .
it is a question for our own decision whether she shall be received or not .
the two governments having already agreed through their respective organs on the terms of annexation , i would recommend their adoption by congress in the form of a joint resolution or act to be perfected and made binding on the two countries when adopted in like manner by the government of texas .
in order that the subject may be fully presented in all its bearings , the correspondence which has taken place in reference to it since the adjournment of congress between the united states , texas , and mexico is herewith transmitted .
the amendments proposed by the senate to the convention concluded between the united states and mexico on the 20th of november , 1843 , have been transmitted through our minister for the concurrence of the mexican government , but , although urged thereto , no action has yet been had on the subject , nor has any answer been given which would authorize a favorable conclusion in the future .
the decree of september , 1843 , in relation to the retail trade , the order for the expulsion of foreigners , and that of a more recent date in regard to passports -- all which are considered as in violation of the treaty of amity and commerce between the two countries -- have led to a correspondence of considerable length between the minister for foreign relations and our representatives at mexico , but without any satisfactory result .
they remain still unadjusted , and many and serious inconveniences have already resulted to our citizens in consequence of them .
questions growing out of the act of disarming a body of texan troops under the command of major snively by an officer in the service of the united states , acting under the orders of our government , and the forcible entry into the custom - house at bryarlys landing , on red river , by certain citizens of the united states , and taking away therefrom the goods seized by the collector of the customs as forfeited under the laws of texas , have been adjusted so far as the powers of the executive extend .
the correspondence between the two governments in reference to both subjects will be found amongst the accompanying documents .
it contains a full statement of all the facts and circumstances , with the views taken on both sides and the principles on which the questions have been adjusted .
it remains for congress to make the necessary appropriation to carry the arrangement into effect , which i respectfully recommend .
the greatly improved condition of the treasury affords a subject for general congratulation .
the paralysis which had fallen on trade and commerce , and which subjected the government to the necessity of resorting to loans and the issue of treasury notes to a large amount , has passed away , and after the payment of upward of $ 7,000,000 on account of the interest , and in redemption of more than $ 5,000,000 of the public debt which falls due on the 1st of january next , and setting apart upward of $ 2,000,000 for the payment of outstanding treasury notes and meeting an installment of the debts of the corporate cities of the district of columbia , an estimated surplus of upward of $ 7,000,000 over and above the existing appropriations will remain in the treasury at the close of the fiscal year .
should the treasury notes continue outstanding as heretofore , that surplus will be considerably augmented .
although all interest has ceased upon them and the government has invited their return to the treasury , yet they remain outstanding , affording great facilities to commerce , and establishing the fact that under a well - regulated system of finance the government has resources within itself which render it independent in time of need , not only of private loans , but also of bank facilities .
the only remaining subject of regret is that the remaining stocks of the government do not fall due at an earlier day , since their redemption would be entirely within its control .
as it is , it may be well worthy the consideration of congress whether the law establishing the sinking fund ( under the operation of which the debts of the revolution and last war with great britain were to a great extent extinguished ) should not , with proper modifications , so as to prevent an accumulation of surpluses , and limited in amount to a specific sum , be reenacted .
such provision , which would authorize the government to go into the market for a purchase of its own stock on fair terms , would serve to maintain its credit at the highest point and prevent to a great extent those fluctuations in the price of its securities which might under other circumstances affect its credit .
no apprehension of this sort is at this moment entertained , since the stocks of the government , which but two years ago were offered for sale to capitalists at home and abroad at a depreciation , and could find no purchasers , are now greatly above par in the hands of the holders ; but a wise and prudent forecast admonishes us to place beyond the reach of contingency the public credit .
it must also be a matter of unmingled gratification that under the existing financial system ( resting upon the act of 1789 and the resolution of 1816 ) the currency of the country has attained a state of perfect soundness ; and the rates of exchange between different parts of the union , which in 1841 denoted by their enormous amount the great depreciation and , in fact , worthlessness of the currency in most of the states , are now reduced to little more than the mere expense of transporting specie from place to place and the risk incident to the operation .
in a new country like that of the united states , where so many inducements are held out for speculation , the depositories of the surplus revenue , consisting of banks of any description , when it reaches any considerable amount , require the closest vigilance on the part of the government .
all banking institutions , under whatever denomination they may pass , are governed by an almost exclusive regard to the interest of the stockholders .
that interest consists in the augmentation of profits in the form of dividends , and a large surplus revenue intrusted to their custody is but too apt to lead to excessive loans and to extravagantly large issues of paper .
as a necessary consequence prices are nominally increased and the speculative mania very soon seizes upon the public mind .
a fictitious state of prosperity for a season exists , and , in the language of the day , money becomes plenty .
contracts are entered into by individuals resting on this unsubstantial state of things , but the delusion speedily passes away and the country is overrun with an indebtedness so weighty as to overwhelm many and to visit every department of industry with great and ruinous embarrassment .
the greatest vigilance becomes necessary on the part of government to guard against this state of things .
the depositories must be given distinctly to understand that the favors of the government will be altogether withdrawn , or substantially diminished , if its revenues shall be regarded as additions to their banking capital or as the foundation of an enlarged circulation .
the government , through its revenue , has at all times an important part to perform in connection with the currency , and it greatly depends upon its vigilance and care whether the country be involved in embarrassments similar to those which it has had recently to encounter , or , aided by the action of the treasury , shall be preserved in a sound and healthy condition .
the dangers to be guarded against are greatly augmented by too large a surplus of revenue .
when that surplus greatly exceeds in amount what shall be required by a wise and prudent forecast to meet unforeseen contingencies , the legislature itself may come to be seized with a disposition to indulge in extravagant appropriations to objects many of which may , and most probably would , be found to conflict with the constitution .
a fancied expediency is elevated above constitutional authority , and a reckless and wasteful extravagance but too certainly follows .
the important power of taxation , which when exercised in its most restricted form is a burthen on labor and production , is resorted to under various pretexts for purposes having no affinity to the motives which dictated its grant , and the extravagance of government stimulates individual extravagance until the spirit of a wild and ill - regulated speculation involves one and all in its unfortunate results .
in view of such fatal consequences , it may be laid down as an axiom rounded in moral and political truth that no greater taxes should be imposed than are necessary for an economical administration of the government , and that whatever exists beyond should be reduced or modified .
this doctrine does in no way conflict with the exercise of a sound discrimination in the selection of the articles to be taxed , which a due regard to the public weal would at all times suggest to the legislative mind .
it leaves the range of selection undefined ; and such selection should always be made with an eye to the great interests of the country .
composed as is the union of separate and independent states , a patriotic legislature will not fail in consulting the interests of the parts to adopt such course as will be best calculated to advance the harmony of the whole , and thus insure that permanency in the policy of the government without which all efforts to advance the public prosperity are vain and fruitless .
this great and vitally important task rests with congress , and the executive can do no more than recommend the general principles which should govern in its execution .
i refer you to the report of the secretary of war for an exhibition of the condition of the army , and recommend to you as well worthy your best consideration many of the suggestions it contains .
the secretary in no degree exaggerates the great importance of pressing forward without delay in the work of erecting and finishing the fortifications to which he particularly alludes .
much has been done toward placing our cities and roadsteads in a state of security against the hazards of hostile attack within the last four years ; but considering the new elements which have been of late years employed in the propelling of ships and the formidable implements of destruction which have been brought into service , we can not be too active or vigilant in preparing and perfecting the means of defense .
i refer you also to his report for a full statement of the condition of the indian tribes within our jurisdiction .
the executive has abated no effort in carrying into effect the well - established policy of the government which contemplates a removal of all the tribes residing within the limits of the several states beyond those limits , and it is now enabled to congratulate the country at the prospect of an early consummation of this object .
many of the tribes have already made great progress in the arts of civilized life , and through the operation of the schools established among them , aided by the efforts of the pious men of various religious denominations who devote themselves to the task of their improvement , we may fondly hope that the remains of the formidable tribes which were once masters of this country will in their transition from the savage state to a condition of refinement and cultivation add another bright trophy to adorn the labors of a well - directed philanthropy .
the accompanying report of the secretary of the navy will explain to you the situation of that branch of the service .
the present organization of the department imparts to its operations great efficiency , but i concur fully in the propriety of a division of the bureau of construction , equipment , increase , and repairs into two bureaus .
the subjects as now arranged are incongruous , and require to a certain extent information and qualifications altogether dissimilar .
the operations of the squadron on the coast of africa have been conducted with all due attention to the object which led to its origination , and i am happy to say that the officers and crews have enjoyed the best possible health under the system adopted by the officer in command .
it is believed that the united states is the only nation which has by its laws subjected to the punishment of death as pirates those who may be engaged in the slave trade .
a similar enactment on the part of other nations would not fail to be attended by beneficial results .
in consequence of the difficulties which have existed in the way of securing titles for the necessary grounds , operations have not yet been commenced toward the establishment of the navy - yard at memphis .
so soon as the title is perfected no further delay will be permitted to intervene .
it is well worthy of your consideration whether congress should not direct the establishment of a ropewalk in connection with the contemplated navy - yard , as a measure not only of economy , but as highly useful and necessary .
the only establishment of the sort now connected with the service is located at boston , and the advantages of a similar establishment convenient to the hemp - growing region must be apparent to all .
the report of the secretary presents other matters to your consideration of an important character in connection with the service .
in referring you to the accompanying report of the postmaster - general it affords me continued cause of gratification to be able to advert to the fact that the affairs of the department for the last four years have been so conducted as from its unaided resources to meet its large expenditures .
on my coming into office a debt of nearly $ 500,000 existed against the department , which congress discharged by an appropriation from the treasury .
the department on the 4th of march next will be found , under the management of its present efficient head , free of debt or embarrassment , which could only have been done by the observance and practice of the greatest vigilance and economy .
the laws have contemplated throughout that the department should be self - sustained , but it may become necessary , with the wisest regard to the public interests , to introduce amendments and alterations in the system .
there is a strong desire manifested in many quarters so to alter the tariff of letter postage as to reduce the amount of tax at present imposed .
should such a measure be carried into effect to the full extent desired , it can not well be doubted but that for the first years of its operation a diminished revenue would be collected , the supply of which would necessarily constitute a charge upon the treasury .
whether such a result would be desirable it will be for congress in its wisdom to determine .
it may in general be asserted as true that radical alterations in any system should rather be brought about gradually than by sudden changes and by pursuing this prudent policy in the reduction of letter postage the department might still sustain itself through the revenue which would accrue by the increase of letters .
the state and condition of the public treasury has heretofore been such as to have precluded the recommendation of any material change .
the difficulties upon this head have , however , ceased , and a larger discretion is now left to the government .
i can not too strongly urge the policy of authorizing the establishment of a line of steamships regularly to ply between this country and foreign ports and upon our own waters for the transportation of the mail .
the example of the british government is well worthy of imitation in this respect .
the belief is strongly entertained that the emoluments arising from the transportation of mail matter to foreign countries would operate of itself as an inducement to cause individual enterprise to undertake that branch of the task , and the remuneration of the government would consist in the addition readily made to our steam navy in case of emergency by the ships so employed .
should this suggestion meet your approval , the propriety of placing such ships under the command of experienced officers of the navy will not escape your observation .
the application of steam to the purposes of naval warfare cogently recommends an extensive steam marine as important in estimating the defenses of the country .
fortunately this may be obtained by us to a great extent without incurring any large amount of expenditure .
steam vessels to be engaged in the transportation of the mails on our principal water courses , lakes , and ports of our coast could also be so constructed as to be efficient as war vessels when needed , and would of themselves constitute a formidable force in order to repel attacks from abroad .. we can not be blind to the fact that other nations have already added large numbers of steamships to their naval armaments and that this new and powerful agent is destined to revolutionize the condition of the world .
it becomes the united states , therefore , looking to their security , to adopt a similar policy , and the plan suggested will enable them to do so at a small comparative cost .
i take the greatest pleasure in bearing testimony to the zeal and untiring industry which has characterized the conduct of the members of the executive cabinet .
each in his appropriate sphere has rendered me the most efficient aid in carrying on the government , and it will not , i trust , appear out of place for me to bear this public testimony .
the cardinal objects which should ever be held in view by those intrusted with the administration of public affairs are rigidly , and without favor or affection , so to interpret the national will expressed in the laws as that injustice should be done to none , justice to all .
this has been the rule upon which they have acted , and thus it is believed that few cases , if any , exist wherein our fellow - citizens , who from time to time have been drawn to the seat of government for the settlement of their transactions with the government , have gone away dissatisfied .
where the testimony has been perfected and was esteemed satisfactory their claims have been promptly audited , and this in the absence of all favoritism or partiality .
the government which is not just to its own people can neither claim their affection nor the respect of the world .
at the same time , the closest attention has been paid to those matters which relate more immediately to the great concerns of the country .
order and efficiency in each branch of the public service have prevailed , accompanied by a system of the most rigid responsibility on the part of the receiving and disbursing agents .
the fact , in illustration of the truth of this remark , deserves to be noticed that the revenues of the government , amounting in the last four years to upward of $ 120,000,000 , have been collected and disbursed through the numerous governmental agents without the loss by default of any amount worthy of serious commentary .
the appropriations made by congress for the improvement of the rivers of the west and of the harbors on the lakes are in a course of judicious expenditure under suitable agents , and are destined , it is to be hoped , to realize all the benefits designed to be accomplished by congress .
i can not , however , sufficiently impress upon congress the great importance of withholding appropriations from improvements which are not ascertained by previous examination and survey to be necessary for the shelter and protection of trade from the dangers of stores and tempests .
without this precaution the expenditures are but too apt to inure to the benefit of individuals , without reference to the only consideration which can render them constitutional -- the public interests and the general good .
i can not too earnestly urge upon you the interests of this district , over which by the constitution congress has exclusive jurisdiction .
it would be deeply to be regretted should there be at any time ground to complain of neglect on the part of a community which , detached as it is from the parental care of the states of virginia and maryland , can only expect aid from congress as its local legislature .
amongst the subjects which claim your attention is the prompt organization of an asylum for the insane who may be found from time to time sojourning within the district .
such course is also demanded by considerations which apply to branches of the public service .
for the necessities in this behalf i invite your particular attention to the report of the secretary of the navy .
i have thus , gentlemen of the two houses of congress , presented you a true and faithful picture of the condition of public affairs , both foreign and domestic .
the wants of the public service are made known to you , and matters of no ordinary importance are urged upon your consideration .
shall i not be permitted to congratulate you on the happy auspices under which you have assembled and at the important change in the condition of things which has occurred in the last three years ?
during that period questions with foreign powers of vital importance to the peace of our country have been settled and adjusted .
a desolating and wasting war with savage tribes has been brought to a close .
the internal tranquillity of the country , threatened by agitating questions , has been preserved .
the credit of the government , which had experienced a temporary embarrassment , has been thoroughly restored .
its coffers , which for a season were empty , have been replenished .
a currency nearly uniform in its value has taken the place of one depreciated and almost worthless .
commerce and manufactures , which had suffered in common with every other interest , have once more revived , and the whole country exhibits an aspect of prosperity and happiness .
trade and barter , no longer governed by a wild and speculative mania , rest upon a solid and substantial footing , and the rapid growth of our cities in every direction bespeaks most strongly the favorable circumstances by which we are surrounded .
my happiness in the retirement which shortly awaits me is the ardent hope which i experience that this state of prosperity is neither deceptive nor destined to be short lived , and that measures which have not yet received its sanction , but which i can not but regard as closely connected with the honor , the glory , and still more enlarged prosperity of the country , are destined at an early day to receive the approval of congress .
under these circumstances and with these anticipations i shall most gladly leave to others more able than myself the noble and pleasing task of sustaining the public prosperity .
i shall carry with me into retirement the gratifying reflection that as my sole object throughout has been to advance the public good i may not entirely have failed in accomplishing it ; and this gratification is heightened in no small degree by the fact that when under a deep and abiding sense of duty i have found myself constrained to resort to the qualified veto it has neither been followed by disapproval on the part of the people nor weakened in any degree their attachment to that great conservative feature of our government .

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states : 
 i communicate herewith to congress copies of a correspondence which has recently taken place between certain agents of the government of the hawaiian or sandwich islands and the secretary of state .
the condition of those islands has excited a good deal of interest , which is increasing by every successive proof that their inhabitants are making progress in civilization and becoming more and more competent to maintain regular and orderly civil government .
they lie in the pacific ocean , much nearer to this continent than the other , and have become an important place for the refitment and provisioning of american and european vessels .
owing to their locality and to the course of the winds which prevail in this quarter of the world , the sandwich islands are the stopping place for almost all vessels passing from continent to continent across the pacific ocean .
they are especially resorted to by the great number of vessels of the united states which are , engaged in the whale fishery in those seas .
the number of vessels of all sorts and the amount of property owned by citizens of the united states which are found in those islands in the course of the year are stated probably with sufficient accuracy in the letter of the agents .
just emerging from a state of barbarism , the government of the islands is as yet feeble , but its dispositions appear to be just and pacific , and it seems anxious to improve the condition of its people by the introduction of knowledge , of religious and moral institutions , means of education , and the arts of civilized life .
it can not but be in conformity with the interest and wishes of the government and the people of the united states that this community , thus existing in the midst of a vast expanse of ocean , should be respected and all its rights strictly and conscientiously regarded ; and this must also be the true interest of all other commercial states .
far remote from the dominions of european powers , its growth and prosperity as an independent state may yet be in a high degree useful to all whose trade is extended to those regions ; while its near approach to this continent and the intercourse which american vessels have with it , such vessels constituting five - sixths of all which annually visit it , could not but create dissatisfaction on the part of the united states at any attempt by another power , should such attempt be threatened or feared , to take possession of the islands , colonize them , and subvert the native government .
considering , therefore , that the united states possesses so large a share of the intercourse with those islands , it is deemed not unfit to make the declaration that their government seeks , nevertheless , no peculiar advantages , no exclusive control over the hawaiian government , but is content with its independent existence and anxiously wishes for its security and prosperity .
its forbearance in this respect under the circumstances of the very large intercourse of their citizens with the islands would justify this government , should events hereafter arise to require it , in making a decided remonstrance against the adoption of an opposite policy by any other power .
under the circumstances i recommend to congress to provide for a moderate allowance to be made out of the treasury to the consul residing there , that in a government so new and a country so remote american citizens may have respectable authority to which to apply for redress in case of injury to their persons and property , and to whom the government of the country may also make known any acts committed by american citizens of which it may think it has a right to complain .
events of considerable importance have recently transpired in china .
the military operations carried on against that empire by the english government have been terminated by a treaty , according to the terms of which four important ports hitherto shut against foreign commerce are to be open to british merchants , viz , amoy , foo - choo - foo , ningpo , and chinghai .
it can not but be interesting to the mercantile interest of the united states , whose intercourse with china at the single port of canton has already become so considerable , to ascertain whether these other ports now open to british commerce are to remain shut , nevertheless , against the commerce of the united states .
the treaty between the chinese government and the british commissioner provides neither for the admission nor the exclusion of the ships of other nations .
it would seem , therefore , that it remains with every other nation having commercial intercourse with china to seek to make proper arrangements for itself with the government of that empire in this respect .
the importations into the united states from china are known to be large , having amounted in some years , as will be seen by the annexed tables , to $ 9,000,000 .
the exports , too , from the united states to china constitute an interesting and growing part of the commerce of the country .
it appears that in the year 1841 , in the direct trade between the two countries , the value of the exports from the united states amounted to $ 715,000 in domestic produce and $ 485,000 in foreign merchandise .
but the whole amount of american produce which finally reaches china and is there consumed is not comprised in these tables , which show only the direct trade .
many vessels with american products on board sail with a primary destination to other countries , but ultimately dispose of more or less of their cargoes in the port of canton .
the peculiarities of the chinese government and the chinese character are well known .
an empire supposed to contain 300,000,000 subjects , fertile in various rich products of the earth , not without the knowledge of letters and of many arts , and with large and expensive accommodations for internal intercourse and traffic , has for ages sought to exclude the visits of strangers and foreigners from its dominions , and has assumed for itself a superiority over all other nations .
events appear likely to break down and soften this spirit of nonintercourse and to bring china ere long into the relations which usually subsist between civilized states .
she has agreed in the treaty with england that correspondence between the agents of the two governments shall be on equal terms -- a concession which it is hardly probable will hereafter be withheld from other nations .
it is true that the cheapness of labor among the chinese , their ingenuity in its application , and the fixed character of their habits and pursuits may discourage the hope of the opening of any great and sudden demand for the fabrics of other countries .
but experience proves that the productions of western nations find a market to some extent among the chinese ; that that market , so far as respects the productions of the united states , although it has considerably varied in successive seasons , has on the whole more than doubled within the last ten years ; and it can hardly be doubted that the opening of several new and important ports connected with parts of the empire heretofore seldom visited by europeans or americans would exercise a favorable influence upon the demand for such productions .
it is not understood that the immediate establishment of correspondent embassies and missions or the permanent residence of diplomatic functionaries with full powers of each country at the court of the other is contemplated between england and china , although , as has been already observed , it has been stipulated that intercourse between the two countries shall hereafter be on equal terms .
an ambassador or envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary can only be accredited , according to the usages of western nations , to the head or sovereign of the state , and it may be doubtful whether the court of pekin is yet prepared to conform to these usages so far as to receive a minister plenipotentiary to reside near it .
being of opinion , however , that the commercial interests of the united states connected with china require at the present moment a degree of attention and vigilance such as there is no agent of this government on the spot to bestow , i recommend to congress to make appropriation for the compensation of a commissioner to reside in china to exercise a watchful care over the concerns of american citizens and for the protection of their persons and property , empowered to hold intercourse with the local authorities , and ready , under instructions from his government , should such instructions become necessary and proper hereafter , to address himself to the high functionaries of the empire , or through them to the emperor himself .
it will not escape the observation of congress that in order to secure the important object of any such measure a citizen of much intelligence and weight of character should be employed on such agency , and that to secure the services of such an individual a compensation should be made corresponding with the magnitude and importance of the mission .

to the house of representatives of the united states : 
 it is with unfeigned regret that i find myself under the necessity of returning to the house of representatives with my objections a bill entitled " an act to provide revenue from imports , and to change and modify existing laws imposing duties on imports , and for other purposes . "
nothing can be more painful to any individual called upon to perform the chief executive duties under our limited constitution than to be constrained to withhold his assent from an important measure adopted by the legislature .
yet he would neither fulfill the high purposes of his station nor consult the true interests or the solemn will of the people -- the common constituents of both branches of the government -- by yielding his well - considered , most deeply fixed , and repeatedly declared opinions on matters of great public concernment to those of a coordinate department without requesting that department seriously to reexamine the subject of their difference .
the exercise of some independence of judgment in regard to all acts of legislation is plainly implied in the responsibility of approving them .
at all times a duty , it becomes a peculiarly solemn and imperative one when the subjects passed upon by congress happen to involve , as in the present instance , the most momentous issues , to affect variously the various parts of a great country , and to have given rise in all quarters to such a conflict of opinion as to render it impossible to conjecture with any certainty on which side the majority really is .
surely if the pause for reflection intended by the wise authors of the constitution by referring the subject back to congress for reconsideration be ever expedient and necessary it is precisely such a case as the present .
on the subject of distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands in the existing state of the finances it has been my duty to make known my settled convictions on various occasions during the present session of congress .
at the opening of the extra session , upward of twelve months ago , sharing fully in the general hope of returning prosperity and credit , i recommended such a distribution , but that recommendation was even then expressly coupled with the condition that the duties on imports should not exceed the rate of 20 per cent provided by the compromise act of 1833 .
these hopes were not a little encouraged and these views strengthened by the report of mr. ewing , then secretary of the treasury , which was shortly thereafter laid before congress , in which he recommended the imposition of duties at the rate of 20 per cent ad valorem on all free articles , with specified exceptions , and stated " if this measure be adopted there will be received in the treasury from customs in the last quarter of the present year $ 5,300,000 ; in all of the year 1842 , about $ 22,500,000 ; and in the year 1843 , after the final reduction under the act of march 2 , 1833 , about $ 20,800,000 ; " and adds : 
 it is believed that after the heavy expenditures required by the public service in the present year shall have been provided for , the revenues which will accrue from that or a nearly approximate rate of duty will be sufficient to defray the expenses of the government and leave a surplus to be annually applied to the gradual payment of the national debt , leaving the proceeds of the public lands to be disposed of as congress shall see fit .
i was most happy that congress at the time seemed entirely to concur in the recommendations of the executive , and , anticipating the correctness of the secretary 's conclusions , and in view of an actual surplus , passed the distribution act of the 4th september last , wisely limiting its operation by two conditions having reference , both of them , to a possible state of the treasury different from that which had been anticipated by the secretary of the treasury and to the paramount necessities of the public service .
it ordained that " if at any time during the existence of that act there should be an imposition of duties on imports inconsistent with the provision of the act of the 2d march , 1833 , and beyond the rate of duties fixed by that act , to wit , 20 per cent on the value of such imports or any of them , then the distribution should be suspended , and should continue so suspended until that cause should be removed . "
by a previous clause it had , in a like spirit of wise and cautious patriotism , provided for another case , in which all are even now agreed , that the proceeds of the sales of the public lands should be used for the defense of the country .
it was enacted that the act should continue and be in force until otherwise provided by law , unless the united states should become involved in war with any foreign power , in which event , from the commencement of hostilities , the act should be suspended until the cessation of hostilities .
not long after the opening of the present session of congress the unprecedented and extraordinary difficulties that have recently embarrassed the finances of the country began to assume a serious aspect .
it soon became quite evident that the hopes under which the act of 4th september was passed , and which alone justified it in the eyes either of congress who imposed or of the executive who approved , the first of the two conditions just recited were not destined to be fulfilled .
under the pressure , therefore , of the embarrassments which had thus unexpectedly arisen it appeared to me that the course to be pursued had been clearly marked out for the government by that act itself .
the condition contemplated in it as requiring a suspension of its operation had occurred .
it became necessary in the opinions of all to raise the rate of duties upon imports above 20 per cent ; and with a view both to provide available means to meet present exigencies and to lay the foundation for a successful negotiation of a loan , i felt it incumbent on me to urge upon congress to raise the duties accordingly , imposing them in a spirit of a wise discrimination for the twofold object of affording ample revenue for the government and incidental protection to the various branches of domestic industry .
i also pressed , in the most emphatic but respectful language i could employ , the necessity of making the land sales available to the treasury , as the basis of public credit .
i did not think that i could stand excused , much less justified , before the people of the united states , nor could i reconcile it to myself to recommend the imposition of additional taxes upon them without at the same time urging the employment of all the legitimate means of the government toward satisfying its wants .
these opinions were communicated in advance of any definitive action of congress on the subject either of the tariff or land sales , under a high sense of public duty and in compliance with an express injunction of the constitution , so that if a collision , extremely to be deprecated , as such collisions always are , has seemingly arisen between the executive and legislative branches of the government , it has assuredly not been owing to any capricious interference or to any want of a plain and frank declaration of opinion on the part of the former .
congress differed in its views with those of the executive , as it had undoubtedly a right to do , and passed a bill virtually for a time repealing the proviso of the act of the 4th september , 1841 .
the bill was returned to the house in which it originated with my objections to its becoming a law .
with a view to prevent , if possible , an open disagreement of opinion on a point so important , i took occasion to declare that i regarded it as an indispensable prerequisite to an increase of duties above 20 per cent that the act of the 4th september should remain unrepealed in its provisions .
my reasons for that opinion were elaborately set forth in the message which accompanied the return of the bill , which no constitutional majority appears to have been found for passing into a law .
the bill which is now before me proposes in its twenty - seventh section the total repeal of one of the provisos in the act of september , and , while it increases the duties above 20 per cent , directs an unconditional distribution of the land proceeds .
i am therefore subjected a second time in the period of a few days to the necessity of either giving my approval to a measure which , in my deliberate judgment , is in conflict with great public interests or of returning it to the house in which it originated with my objections .
with all my anxiety for the passage of a law which would replenish an exhausted treasury and furnish a sound and healthy encouragement to mechanical industry , i can not consent to do so at the sacrifice of the peace and harmony of the country and the clearest convictions of public duty .
for some of the reasons which have brought me to this conclusion i refer to my previous messages to congress , and briefly subjoin the following : 
 1 .
the bill unites two subjects which , so far from having any affinity to one another , are wholly incongruous in their character .
it is both a revenue and an appropriation bill .
it thus imposes on the executive , in the first place , the necessity of either approving that which he would reject or rejecting that which he might otherwise approve .
this is a species of constraint to which the judgment of the executive ought not , in my opinion , to be subjected .
but that is not my only objection to the act in its present form .
the union of subjects wholly dissimilar in their character in the same bill , if it grew into a practice , would not fail to lead to consequences destructive of all wise and conscientious legislation .
various measures , each agreeable only to a small minority , might by being thus united -- and the more the greater chance of success -- lead to the passing of laws of which no single provision could if standing alone command a majority in its favor .
2 .
while the treasury is in a state of extreme embarrassment , requiring every dollar which it can make available , and when the government has not only to lay additional taxes , but to borrow money to meet pressing demands , the bill proposes to give away a fruitful source of revenue -- which is the same thing as raising money by loan and taxation -- not to meet the wants of the government , but for distribution -- a proceeding which i must regard as highly impolitic , if not unconstitutional .
a brief review of the present condition of the public finances will serve to illustrate the true condition of the treasury and exhibit its actual necessities : 
 on the 5th of august ( friday last ) there was in the 
 treasury , in round numbers------------------------------------------------------ $ 2,150,000 
 necessary to be retained to meet trust funds -------------------------------------- $ 360,000 
 interest on public debt due in october----------------------------------------------- 80,000 
 to redeem treasury notes and pay the interest-------------------------------------- 100,000 
 land distribution under the act of the 4th of september , 1841 - -------------------- 640,000 
 1,180,000 
 leaving an available amount of----------------------------------------------- 970,000 
 the navy department had drawn requisitions on the treasury at that time to meet debts actually due , among which are bills under protest for 1,414,000 , thus leaving an actual deficit of $ 444,000 .
there was on hand about $ 100,000 of unissued treasury notes , assisted by the accruing revenue ( amounting to about $ 150,000 per week , exclusive of receipts on unpaid bonds ) , to meet requisitions for the army and the demands of the civil list .
the withdrawal of the sum of $ 640,000 to be distributed among the states , so soon as the statements and accounts can be made up and completed , by virtue of the provisions of the act of the 4th of september last ( of which nearly a moiety goes to a few states , and only about $ 383,000 is to be divided among all the states ) , while it adds materially to the embarrassments of the treasury , affords to the states no decided relief .
no immediate relief from this state of things is anticipated unless ( what would most deeply be deplored ) the government could be reconciled to the negotiation of loans already authorized by law at a rate of discount ruinous in itself and calculated most seriously to affect the public credit .
so great is the depression of trade that even if the present bill were to become a law and prove to be productive some time would elapse before sufficient supplies would flow into the treasury , while in the meantime its embarrassments would be continually augmented by the semiannual distribution of the land proceeds .
indeed , there is but too much ground to apprehend that even if this bill were permitted to become a law -- alienating , as it does , the proceeds of the land sales -- an actual deficit in the treasury would occur , which would more than probably involve the necessity of a resort to direct taxation .
let it be also remarked that $ 5,500,000 of the public debt becomes redeemable in about two years and a half , which at any sacrifice must be met , while the treasury is always liable to demands for the payment of outstanding treasury notes .
such is the gloomy picture which our financial department now presents , and which calls for the exercise of a rigid economy in the public expenditures and the rendering available of all the means within the control of the government .
i most respectfully submit whether this is a time to give away the proceeds of the land sales when the public lands constitute a fund which of all others may be made most useful in sustaining the public credit .
can the government be generous and munificent to others when every dollar it can command is necessary to supply its own wants ?
and if congress would not hesitate to suffer the provisions of the act of 4th september last to remain unrepealed in case the country was involved in war , is not the necessity for such a course now just as imperative as it would be then ?
3 .
a third objection remains to be urged , which would be sufficient in itself to induce me to return the bill to the house with my objections .
by uniting two subjects so incongruous as tariff and distribution it inevitably makes the fate of the one dependent upon that of the other in future contests of party .
can anything be more fatal to the merchant or manufacturer than such an alliance ?
what they most of all require is a system of moderate duties so arranged as to withdraw the tariff question , as far as possible , completely from the arena of political contention .
their chief want is permanency and stability .
such an increase of the tariff i believe to be necessary in order to meet the economical expenditures of government .
such an increase , made in the spirit of moderation and judicious discrimination , would , i have no doubt , be entirely satisfactory to the great majority of the american people .
in the way of accomplishing a measure so salutary and so imperatively demanded by every public interest , the legislative department will meet with a cordial cooperation on the part of the executive .
this is all that the manufacturer can desire , and it would be a burden readily borne by the people .
but i can not too earnestly repeat that in order to be beneficial it must be permanent , and in order to be permanent it must command general acquiescence .
but can such permanency be justly hoped for if the tariff question be coupled with that of distribution , as to which a serious conflict of opinion exists among the states and the people , and which enlists in its support a bare majority , if , indeed , there be a majority , of the two houses of congress ?
what permanency or stability can attach to a measure which , warring upon itself , gives away a fruitful source of revenue at the moment it proposes a large increase of taxes on the people ?
is the manufacturer prepared to stake himself and his interests upon such an issue ?
i know that it is urged ( but most erroneously , in my opinion ) that instability is just as apt to be produced by retaining the public lands as a source of revenue as from any other cause , and this is ascribed to a constant fluctuation , as it is said , in the amount of sales .
if there were anything in this objection , it equally applies to every imposition of duties on imports .
the amount of revenue annually derived from duties is constantly liable to change .
the regulations of foreign governments , the varying productiveness of other countries , periods of excitement in trade , and a great variety of other circumstances are constantly arising to affect the state of commerce , foreign and domestic , and , of consequence , the revenue levied upon it .
the sales of the public domain in ordinary times are regulated by fixed laws which have their basis in a demand increasing only in the ratio of the increase of population .
in recurring to the statistics connected with this subject it will be perceived that for a period of ten years preceding 1834 the average amount of land sales did not exceed $ 2,000,000 .
for the increase which took place in 1834 , 1835 , and 1836 we are to look to that peculiar condition of the country which grew out of one of the most extraordinary excitements in business and speculation that has ever occurred in the history of commerce and currency .
it was the fruit of a wild spirit of adventure engendered by a vicious system of credits , under the evils of which the country is still laboring , and which it is fondly hoped will not soon recur .
considering the vast amount of investments made by private individuals in the public lands during those three years , and which equaled $ 43,000,000 ( equal to more than twenty years ' purchase ) , taking the average of sales of the ten preceding years , it may be safely asserted that the result of the public - land sales can hold out nothing to alarm the manufacturer with the idea of instability in the revenues and consequently in the course of the government .
under what appears to me , therefore , the soundest considerations of public policy , and in view of the interests of every branch of domestic industry , i return you the bill with these my objections to its becoming a law .
i take occasion emphatically to repeat my anxious desire to cooperate with congress in the passing of a law which , while it shall assist in supplying the wants of the treasury and reestablish public credit , shall afford to the manufacturing interests of the country all the incidental protection they require .
after all , the effect of what i do is substantially to call on congress to reconsider the subject .
if on such reconsideration a majority of two - thirds of both houses should be in favor of this measure , it will become a law notwithstanding my objections .
in a case of clear and manifest error on the part of the president the presumption of the constitution is that such majorities will be found .
should they be so found in this case , having conscientiously discharged my own duty i shall cheerfully acquiesce in the result .

to the house of representatives of the united states : 
 i return to the house of representatives , in which it originated , the bill entitled " an act making appropriations for the improvement of certain harbors and rivers , " with the following objections to its becoming a law : 
 at the adoption of the constitution each state was possessed of a separate and independent sovereignty and an exclusive jurisdiction over all streams and water courses within its territorial limits .
the articles of confederation in no way affected this authority or jurisdiction , and the present constitution , adopted for the purpose of correcting the defects which existed in the original articles , expressly reserves to the states all powers not delegated .
no such surrender of jurisdiction is made by the states to this government by any express grant , and if it is possessed it is to be deduced from the clause in the constitution which invests congress with authority " to make all laws which are necessary and proper for carrying into execution " the granted powers .
there is , in my view of the subject , no pretense whatever for the claim to power which the bill now returned substantially sets up .
the inferential power , in order to be legitimate , must be clearly and plainly incidental to some granted power and necessary to its exercise .
to refer it to the head of convenience or usefulness would be to throw open the door to a boundless and unlimited discretion and to invest congress with an unrestrained authority .
the power to remove obstructions from the water courses of the states is claimed under the granted power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations , among the several states , and with the indian tribes ; " but the plain and obvious meaning of this grant is that congress may adopt rules and regulations prescribing the terms and conditions on which the citizens of the united states may carry on commercial operations with foreign states or kingdoms , and on which the citizens or subjects of foreign states or kingdoms may prosecute trade with the united states or either of them .
and so the power to regulate commerce among the several states no more invests congress with jurisdiction over the water courses of the states than the first branch of the grant does over the water courses of foreign powers , which would be an absurdity .
the right of common use of the people of the united states to the navigable waters of each and every state arises from the express stipulation contained in the constitution that " the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states . "
while , therefore , the navigation of any river in any state is by the laws of such state allowed to the citizens thereof , the same is also secured by the constitution of the united states on the same terms and conditions to the citizens of every other state ; and so of any other privilege or immunity .
the application of the revenue of this government , if the power to do so was admitted , to improving the navigation of the rivers by removing obstructions or otherwise would be for the most part productive only of local benefit .
the consequences might prove disastrously ruinous to as many of our fellow - citizens as the exercise of such power would benefit .
i will take one instance furnished by the present bill -- out of no invidious feeling , for such it would be impossible for me to feel , but because of my greater familiarity with locations -- in illustration of the above opinion : twenty thousand dollars are proposed to be appropriated toward improving the harbor of richmond , in the state of virginia .
such improvement would furnish advantages to the city of richmond and add to the value of the property of its citizens , while it might have a most disastrous influence over the wealth and prosperity of petersburg , which is situated some 25 miles distant on a branch of james river , and which now enjoys its fair portion of the trade .
so , too , the improvement of james river to richmond and of the appomattox to petersburg might , by inviting the trade to those two towns , have the effect of prostrating the town of norfolk .
this , too , might be accomplished without adding a single vessel to the number now engaged in the trade of the chesapeake bay or bringing into the treasury a dollar of additional revenue .
it would produce , most probably , the single effect of concentrating the commerce now profitably enjoyed by three places upon one of them .
this case furnishes an apt illustration of the effect of this bill in several other particulars .
there can not , in fact , be drawn the slightest discrimination between the improving the streams of a state under the power to regulate commerce and the most extended system of internal improvements on land .
the excavating a canal and paving a road are equally as much incidents to such claim of power as the removing obstructions from water courses ; nor can such power be restricted by any fair course of reasoning to the mere fact of making the improvement .
it reasonably extends also to the right of seeking a return of the means expended through the exaction of tolls and the levying of contributions .
thus , while the constitution denies to this government the privilege of acquiring a property in the soil of any state , even for the purpose of erecting a necessary fortification , without a grant from such state , this claim to power would invest it with control and dominion over the waters and soil of each state without restriction .
power so incongruous can not exist in the same instrument .
the bill is also liable to a serious objection because of its blending appropriations for numerous objects but few of which agree in their general features .
this necessarily produces the effect of embarrassing executive action .
some of the appropriations would receive my sanction if separated from the rest , however much i might deplore the reproduction of a system which for some time past has been permitted to sleep with apparently the acquiescence of the country .
i might particularize the delaware breakwater as an improvement which looks to the security from the storms of our extended atlantic seaboard of the vessels of all the country engaged either in the foreign or the coastwise trade , as well as to the safety of the revenue ; but when , in connection with that , the same bill embraces improvements of rivers at points far in the interior , connected alone with the trade of such river and the exertion of mere local influences , no alternative is left me but to use the qualified veto with which the executive is invested by the constitution , and to return the bill to the house in which it originated for its ultimate reconsideration and decision .
in sanctioning a bill of the same title with that returned , for the improvement of the mississippi and its chief tributaries and certain harbors on the lakes , if i bring myself apparently in conflict with any of the principles herein asserted it will arise on my part exclusively from the want of a just appreciation of localities .
the mississippi occupies a footing altogether different from the rivers and water courses of the different states .
no one state or any number of states can exercise any other jurisdiction over it than for the punishment of crimes and the service of civil process .
it belongs to no particular state or states , but of common right , by express reservation , to all the states .
it is reserved as a great common highway for the commerce of the whole country .
to have conceded to louisiana , or to any other state admitted as a new state into the union , the exclusive jurisdiction , and consequently the right to make improvements and to levy tolls on the segments of the river embraced within its territorial limits , would have been to have disappointed the chief object in the purchase of louisiana , which was to secure the free use of the mississippi to all the people of the united states .
whether levies on commerce were made by a foreign or domestic government would have been equally burdensome and objectionable .
the united states , therefore , is charged with its improvement for the benefit of all , and the appropriation of governmental means to its improvement becomes indispensably necessary for the good of all .
as to the harbors on the lakes , the act originates no new improvements , but makes appropriations for the continuance of works already begun .
it is as much the duty of the government to construct good harbors , without reference to the location or interests of cities , for the shelter of the extensive commerce of the lakes as to build breakwaters on the atlantic coast for the protection of the trade of that ocean .
these great inland seas are visited by destructive storms , and the annual loss of ships and cargoes , and consequently of revenue to the government , is immense .
if , then , there be any work embraced by that act which is not required in order to afford shelter and security to the shipping against the tempests which so often sweep over those great inland seas , but has , on the contrary , originated more in a spirit of speculation and local interest than in one of the character alluded to , the house of representatives will regard my approval of the bill more as the result of misinformation than any design to abandon or modify the principles laid down in this message .
every system is liable to run into abuse , and none more so than that under consideration ; and measures can not be too soon taken by congress to guard against this evil .

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states : 
 notwithstanding the urgency with which i have on more than one occasion felt it my duty to press upon congress the necessity of providing the government with the means of discharging its debts and maintaining inviolate the public faith , the increasing embarrassments of the treasury impose upon me the indispensable obligation of again inviting your most serious attention to the condition of the finances .
fortunately for myself in thus bringing this important subject to your view for a deliberate and comprehensive examination in all its bearings , and i trust i may add for a final adjustment of it to the common advantage of the whole union , i am permitted to approach it with perfect freedom and candor .
as few of the burdens for which provision is now required to be made have been brought upon the country during my short administration of its affairs , i have neither motive nor wish to make them a matter of crimination against any of my predecessors .
i am disposed to regard , as i am bound to treat , them as facts which can not now be undone , and as deeply interesting to us all , and equally imposing upon all the most solemn duties ; and the only use i would make of the errors of the past is by a careful examination of their causes and character to avoid if possible the repetition of them in future .
the condition of the country , indeed , is such as may well arrest the conflict of parties .
the conviction seems at length to have made its way to the minds of all that the disproportion between the public responsibilities and the means provided for meeting them is no casual nor transient evil .
it is , on the contrary , one which for some years to come , notwithstanding a resort to all reasonable retrenchments and the constant progress of the country in population and productive power , must continue to increase under existing laws , unless we consent to give up or impair all our defenses in war and peace .
but this is a thought which i am persuaded no patriotic mind would for a moment entertain .
without affecting an alarm , which i do not feel , in regard to our foreign relations , it may safely be affirmed that they are in a state too critical and involve too many momentous issues to permit us to neglect in the least , much less to abandon entirely , those means of asserting our rights without which negotiation is without dignity and peace without security .
in the report of the secretary of the treasury submitted to congress at the commencement of the present session it is estimated that after exhausting all the probable resources of the year there will remain a deficit of about $ 14,000,000 .
with a view partly to a permanent system of revenue and partly to immediate relief from actual embarrassment , that officer recommended , together with a plan for establishing a government exchequer , some expedients of a more temporary character , viz , the issuing of treasury notes and the extension of the time for which the loan authorized to be negotiated by the act of the last session should be taken .
congress accordingly provided for an issue of treasury notes to the amount of $ 5,000,000 , but subject to the condition that they should not be paid away below par .
no measure connected with the last of the two objects above mentioned was introduced until recently into the house of representatives .
should the loan bill now pending before that body pass into a law for its present amount , there would still remain a deficit of $ 2,500,000 .
it requires no argument to show that such a condition of the treasury is incompatible not only with a high state of public credit , but with anything approaching to efficiency in the conduct of public affairs .
it must be obvious even to the most inexperienced minds that , to say nothing of any particular exigency , actual or imminent , there should be at all times in the treasury of a great nation , with a view to contingencies of ordinary occurrence , a surplus at least equal in amount to the above deficiency .
but that deficiency , serious as it would be in itself , will , i am compelled to say , rather be increased than diminished without the adoption of measures adequate to correct the evil at once .
the stagnation of trade and business , in some degree incident to the derangement of the national finances and the state of the revenue laws , holds out but little prospect of relief , in the ordinary course of things , for some time to come .
under such circumstances i am deeply impressed with the necessity of meeting the crisis with a vigor and decision which it imperatively demands at the hands of all intrusted with the conduct of public affairs , the gravity of the evil calls for a remedy proportioned to it .
no slight palliatives or occasional expedients will give the country the relief it needs .
such measures , on the contrary , will in the end , as is now manifest to all , too surely multiply its embarrassments .
relying , as i am bound to do , on the representatives of a people rendered illustrious among nations by having paid off its whole public debt , i shall not shrink from the responsibility imposed upon me by the constitution of pointing out such measures as will in my opinion insure adequate relief .
i am the more encouraged to recommend the course which necessity exacts by the confidence which i have in its complete success .
the resources of the country in everything that constitutes the wealth and strength of nations are so abundant , the spirit of a most industrious , enterprising , and intelligent people is so energetic and elastic , that the government will be without the shadow of excuse for its delinquency if the difficulties which now embarrass it be not speedily and effectually removed .
from present indications it is hardly doubtful that congress will find it necessary to lay additional duties on imports in order to meet the ordinary current expenses of the government .
in the exercise of a sound discrimination having reference to revenue , but at the same time necessarily affording incidental protection to manufacturing industry , it seems equally probable that duties on some articles of importation will have to be advanced above 20 per cent .
in performing this important work of revising the tariff of duties , which in the present emergency would seem to be indispensable , i can not too strongly recommend the cultivation of a spirit of mutual harmony and concession , to which the government itself owes its origin , and without the continued exercise of which jarring and discord would universally prevail .
an additional reason for the increase of duties in some instances beyond the rate of 20 per cent will exist in fulfilling the recommendations already made , and now repeated , of making adequate appropriations for the defenses of the country .
by the express provision of the act distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands among the states its operation is ipso facto to cease so soon as the rate of the duties shall exceed the limits prescribed in the act .
in recommending the adoption of measures for distributing the proceeds of the public lands among the states at the commencement of the last session of congress such distribution was urged by arguments and considerations which appeared to me then and appear to me now of great weight , and was placed on the condition that it should not render necessary any departure from the act of 1833 .
it is with sincere regret that i now perceive the necessity of departing from that act , because i am well aware that expectations justly entertained by some of the states will be disappointed by any occasion which shall withhold from them the proceeds of the lands .
but the condition was plainly expressed in the message and was inserted in terms equally plain in the law itself , and amidst the embarrassments which surround the country on all sides and beset both the general and the state governments it appears to me that the object first and highest in importance is to establish the credit of this government and to place it on durable foundations , and thus afford the most effectual support to the credit of the states , equal at least to what it would receive from a direct distribution of the proceeds of the sales of the public lands .
when the distribution law was passed there was reason to anticipate that there soon would be a real surplus to distribute .
on that assumption it was in my opinion a wise , a just , and a beneficent measure .
but to continue it in force while there is no such surplus to distribute and when it is manifestly necessary not only to increase the duties , but at the same time to borrow money in order to liquidate the public debt and disembarrass the public treasury , would cause it to be regarded as an unwise alienation of the best security of the public creditor , which would with difficulty be excused and could not be justified .
causes of no ordinary character have recently depressed american credit in the stock market of the world to a degree quite unprecedented .
i need scarcely mention the condition of the banking institutions of some of the states , the vast amount of foreign debt contracted during a period of wild speculation by corporations and individuals , and , above all , the doctrine of repudiation of contracts solemnly entered into by states , which , although as yet applied only under circumstances of a peculiar character and generally rebuked with severity by the moral sense of the community , is yet so very licentious and , in a government depending wholly on opinion , so very alarming that the impression made by it to our disadvantage as a people is anything but surprising .
under such circumstances it is imperatively due from us to the people whom we represent that when we go into the money market to contract a loan we should tender such securities as to cause the money lender , as well at home as abroad , to feel that the most propitious opportunity is afforded him of investing profitably and judiciously his capital .
a government which has paid off the debts of two wars , waged with the most powerful nation of modern times , should not be brought to the necessity of chaffering for terms in the money market .
under such circumstances as i have adverted to our object should be to produce with the capitalist a feeling of entire confidence , by a tender of that sort of security which in all times past has been esteemed sufficient , and which for the small amount of our proposed indebtedness will unhesitatingly be regarded as amply adequate .
while a pledge of all the revenues amounts to no more than is implied in every instance when the government contracts a debt , and although it ought in ordinary circumstances to be entirely satisfactory , yet in times like these the capitalist would feel better satisfied with the pledge of a specific fund , ample in magnitude to the payment of his interest and ultimate reimbursement of his principal .
such is the character of the land fund .
the most vigilant money dealer will readily perceive that not only will his interest be secure on such a pledge , but that a debt of $ 18,000,000 or $ 20,000,000 would by the surplus of sales over and above the payment of the interest be extinguished within any reasonable time fixed for its redemption .
to relieve the treasury from its embarrassments and to aid in meeting its requisitions until time is allowed for any new tariff of duties to become available , it would seem to be necessary to fund a debt approaching to $ 15,000,000 ; and in order to place the negotiation of the loan beyond a reasonable doubt i submit to congress whether the proceeds of the sales of the public lands should not be pledged for the payment of the interest , and the secretary of the treasury be authorized out of the surplus of the proceeds of such sales to purchase the stock , when it can be procured on such terms as will render it beneficial in that way , to extinguish the debt and prevent the accumulation of such surplus while its distribution is suspended .
no one can doubt that were the federal treasury now as prosperous as it was ten years ago and its fiscal operations conducted by an efficient agency of its own , coextensive with the union , the embarrassments of the states and corporations in them would produce , even if they continued as they are ( were that possible ) , effects far less disastrous than those now experienced .
it is the disorder here , at the heart and center of the system , that paralyzes and deranges every part of it .
who does not know the permanent importance , not to the federal government alone , but to every state and every individual within its jurisdiction , even in their most independent and isolated individual pursuits , of the preservation of a sound state of public opinion and a judicious administration here ?
the sympathy is instantaneous and universal .
to attempt to remedy the evil of the deranged credit and currency of the states while the disease is allowed to rage in the vitals of this government would be a hopeless undertaking .
it is the full conviction of this truth which emboldens me most earnestly to recommend to your early and serious consideration the measures now submitted to your better judgment , as well as those to which your attention has been already invited .
the first great want of the country , that without answering which all attempts at bettering the present condition of things will prove fruitless , is a complete restoration of the credit and finances of the federal government .
the source and foundation of all credit is in the confidence which the government inspires , and just in proportion as that confidence shall be shaken or diminished will be the distrust among all classes of the community and the derangement and demoralization in every branch of business and all the interests of the country .
keep up the standard of good faith and punctuality in the operations of the general government , and all partial irregularities and disorders will be rectified by the influence of its example ; but suffer that standard to be debased or disturbed , and it is impossible to foresee to what a degree of degradation and confusion all financial interests , public and private , may sink .
in such a country as this the representatives of the people have only to will it and the public credit will be as high as it ever was .
my own views of the measures calculated to effect this great and desirable object i have thus frankly expressed to congress under circumstances which give to the entire subject a peculiar and solemn interest .
the executive can do no more .
if the credit of the country be exposed to question , if the public defenses be broken down or weakened , if the whole administration of public affairs be embarrassed for want of the necessary means for conducting them with vigor and effect , i trust that this department of the government will be found to have done all that was in its power to avert such evils , and will be acquitted of all just blame on account of them .

to the house of representatives of the united states : 
 it is with extreme regret that i feel myself constrained by the duty faithfully to execute the office of president of the united states and to the best of my ability to " preserve , protect , and defend the constitution of the united states " to return to the house in which it originated the bill " to provide for the better collection , safe - keeping , and disbursement of the public revenue by means of a corporation to be styled the fiscal corporation of the united states , " with my written objections .
in my message sent to the senate on the 16th day of august last , returning the bill " to incorporate the subscribers to the fiscal bank of the united states , " i distinctly declared that my own opinion had been uniformly proclaimed to be against the exercise " of the power of congress to create a national bank to operate per se over the union , " and , entertaining that opinion , my main objection to that bill was based upon the highest moral and religious obligations of conscience and the constitution .
i readily admit that whilst the qualified veto with which the chief magistrate is invested should be regarded and was intended by the wise men who made it a part of the constitution as a great conservative principle of our system , without the exercise of which on important occasions a mere representative majority might urge the government in its legislation beyond the limits fixed by its framers or might exert its just powers too hastily or oppressively , yet it is a power which ought to be most cautiously exerted , and perhaps never except in a case eminently involving the public interest or one in which the oath of the president , acting under his convictions , both mental and moral , imperiously requires its exercise .
in such a case he has no alternative .
he must either exert the negative power intrusted to him by the constitution chiefly for its own preservation , protection , and defense or commit an act of gross moral turpitude .
mere regard to the will of a majority must not in a constitutional republic like ours control this sacred and solemn duty of a sworn officer .
the constitution itself i regard and cherish as the embodied and written will of the whole people of the united states .
it is their fixed and fundamental law , which they unanimously prescribe to the public functionaries , their mere trustees and servants .
this their will and the law which they have given us as the rule of our action have no guard , no guaranty of preservation , protection , and defense , but the oaths which it prescribes to the public officers , the sanctity with which they shall religiously observe those oaths , and the patriotism with which the people shall shield it by their own sovereign will , which has made the constitution supreme .
it must be exerted against the will of a mere representative majority or not at all .
it is alone in pursuance of that will that any measure can reach the president , and to say that because a majority in congress have passed a bill he should therefore sanction it is to abrogate the power altogether and to render its insertion in the constitution a work of absolute supererogation .
the duty is to guard the fundamental will of the people themselves from ( in this case , i admit , unintentional ) change or infraction by a majority in congress ; and in that light alone do i regard the constitutional duty which i now most reluctantly discharge .
is this bill now presented for my approval or disapproval such a bill as i have already declared could not receive my sanction ?
is it such a bill as calls for the exercise of the negative power under the constitution ?
does it violate the constitution by creating a national bank to operate per se over the union ?
its title , in the first place , describes its general character .
it is " an act to provide for the better collection , safe - keeping , and disbursement of the public revenue by means of a corporation to be styled the fiscal corporation of the united states . "
in style , then , it is plainly national in its character .
its powers , functions , and duties are those which pertain to the collecting , keeping , and disbursing the public revenue .
the means by which these are to be exerted is a corporation to be styled the fiscal corporation of the united states .
it is a corporation created by the congress of the united states , in its character of a national legislature for the whole union , to perform the fiscal purposes , meet the fiscal wants and exigencies , supply the fiscal uses , and exert the fiscal agencies of the treasury of the united states .
such is its own description of itself .
do its provisions contradict its title ?
they do not .
it is true that by its first section it provides that it shall be established in the district of columbia ; but the amount of its capital , the manner in which its stock is to be subscribed for and held , the persons and bodies , corporate and politic , by whom its stock may be held , the appointment of its directors and their powers and duties , its fundamental articles , especially that to establish agencies in any part of the union , the corporate powers and business of such agencies , the prohibition of congress to establish any other corporation with similar powers for twenty years , with express reservation in the same clause to modify or create any bank for the district of columbia , so that the aggregate capital shall not exceed five millions , without enumerating other features which are equally distinctive and characteristic , clearly show that it can not be regarded as other than a bank of the united states , with powers seemingly more limited than have heretofore been granted to such an institution .
it operates per se over the union by virtue of the unaided and , in my view , assumed authority of congress as a national legislature , as distinguishable from a bank created by congress for the district of columbia as the local legislature of the district .
every united states bank heretofore created has had power to deal in bills of exchange as well as local discounts .
both were trading privileges conferred , and both were exercised by virtue of the aforesaid power of congress over the whole union .
the question of power remains unchanged without reference to the extent of privilege granted .
if this proposed corporation is to be regarded as a local bank of the district of columbia , invested by congress with general powers to operate over the union , it is obnoxious to still stronger objections .
it assumes that congress may invest a local institution with general or national powers .
with the same propriety that it may do this in regard to a bank of the district of columbia it may as to a state bank .
yet who can indulge the idea that this government can rightfully , by making a state bank its fiscal agent , invest it with the absolute and unqualified powers conferred by this bill ?
when i come to look at the details of the bill , they do not recommend it strongly to my adoption .
a brief notice of some of its provisions will suffice .
first .
it may justify substantially a system of discounts of the most objectionable character .
it is to deal in bills of exchange drawn in one state and payable in another without any restraint .
the bill of exchange may have an unlimited time to run , and its renewability is nowhere guarded against .
it may , in fact , assume the most objectionable form of accommodation paper .
it is not required to rest on any actual , real , or substantial exchange basis .
a drawer in one place becomes the accepter in another , and so in turn the accepter may become the drawer upon a mutual understanding .
it may at the same time indulge in mere local discounts under the name of bills of exchange .
a bill drawn at philadelphia on camden , n. j. , at new york on a border town in new jersey , at cincinnati on newport , in kentucky , not to multiply other examples , might , for anything in this bill to restrain it , become a mere matter of local accommodation .
cities thus relatively situated would possess advantages over cities otherwise situated of so decided a character as most justly to excite dissatisfaction .
second .
there is no limit prescribed to the premium in the purchase of bills of exchange , thereby correcting none of the evils under which the community now labors , and operating most injuriously upon the agricultural states , in which the irregularities in the rates of exchange are most severely felt .
nor are these the only consequences .
a resumption of specie payments by the banks of those states would be liable to indefinite postponement ; for as the operation of the agencies of the interior would chiefly consist in selling bills of exchange , and the purchases could only be made in specie or the notes of banks paying specie , the state banks would either have to continue with their doors closed or exist at the mercy of this national monopoly of brokerage .
nor can it be passed over without remark that whilst the district of columbia is made the seat of the principal bank , its citizens are excluded from all participation in any benefit it might afford by a positive prohibition on the bank from all discounting within the district .
these are some of the objections which prominently exist against the details of the bill .
others might be urged of much force , but it would be unprofitable to dwell upon them .
suffice it to add that this charter is designed to continue for twenty years without a competitor ; that the defects to which i have alluded , being founded on the fundamental law of the corporation , are irrevocable , and that if the objections be well founded it would be over hazardous to pass the bill into a law .
in conclusion i take leave most respectfully to say that i have felt the most anxious solicitude to meet the wishes of congress in the adoption of a fiscal agent which , avoiding all constitutional objections , should harmonize conflicting opinions .
actuated by this feeling , i have been ready to yield much in a spirit of conciliation to the opinions of others ; and it is with great pain that i now feel compelled to differ from congress a second time in the same session .
at the commencement of this session , inclined from choice to defer to the legislative will , i submitted to congress the propriety of adopting a fiscal agent which , without violating the constitution , would separate the public money from the executive control and perform the operations of the treasury without being burdensome to the people or inconvenient or expensive to the government .
it is deeply to be regretted that this department of the government can not upon constitutional and other grounds concur with the legislative department in this last measure proposed to attain these desirable objects .
owing to the brief space between the period of the death of my lamented predecessor and my own installation into office , i was , in fact , not left time to prepare and submit a definitive recommendation of my own in my regular message , and since my mind has been wholly occupied in a most anxious attempt to conform my action to the legislative will .
in this communication i am confined by the constitution to my objections simply to this bill , but the period of the regular session will soon arrive , when it will be my duty , under another clause of the constitution , " to give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as " i " shall judge necessary and expedient . "
and i most respectfully submit , in a spirit of harmony , whether the present differences of opinion should be pressed further at this time , and whether the peculiarity of my situation does not entitle me to a postponement of this subject to a more auspicious period for deliberation .
the two houses of congress have distinguished themselves at this extraordinary session by the performance of an immense mass of labor at a season very unfavorable both to health and action , and have passed many laws which i trust will prove highly beneficial to the interests of the country and fully answer its just expectations .
it has been my good fortune and pleasure to concur with them in all measures except this .
and why should our difference on this alone be pushed to extremes ?
it is my anxious desire that it should not be .
i too have been burdened with extraordinary labors of late , and i sincerely desire time for deep and deliberate reflection on this the greatest difficulty of my administration .
may we not now pause until a more favorable time , when , with the most anxious hope that the executive and congress may cordially unite , some measure of finance may be deliberately adopted promotive of the good of our common country ?
i will take this occasion to declare that the conclusions to which i have brought myself are those of a settled conviction , founded , in my opinion , on a just view of the constitution ; that in arriving at it i have been actuated by no other motive or desire than to uphold the institutions of the country as they have come down to us from the hands of our godlike ancestors , and that i shall esteem my efforts to sustain them , even though i perish , more honorable than to win the applause of men by a sacrifice of my duty and my conscience .

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states : 
 in coming together , fellow - citizens , to enter again upon the discharge of the duties with which the people have charged us severally , we find great occasion to rejoice in the general prosperity of the country .
we are in the enjoyment of all the blessings of civil and religious liberty , with unexampled means of education , knowledge , and improvement .
through the year which is now drawing to a close peace has been in our borders and plenty in our habitations , and although disease has visited some few portions of the land with distress and mortality , yet in general the health of the people has been preserved , and we are all called upon by the highest obligations of duty to renew our thanks and our devotion to our heavenly parent , who has continued to vouchsafe to us the eminent blessings which surround us and who has so signally crowned the year with his goodness .
if we find ourselves increasing beyond example in numbers , in strength , in wealth , in knowledge , in everything which promotes human and social happiness , let us ever remember our dependence for all these on the protection and merciful dispensations of divine providence .
since your last adjournment alexander mcleod , a british subject who was indicted for the murder of an american citizen , and whose case has been the subject of a correspondence heretofore communicated to you , has been acquitted by the verdict of an impartial and intelligent jury , and has under the judgment of the court been regularly discharged .
great britain having made known to this government that the expedition which was fitted out from canada for the destruction of the steamboat caroline in the winter of 1837 , and which resulted in the destruction of said boat and in the death of an american citizen , was undertaken by orders emanating from the authorities of the british government in canada , and demanding the discharge of mcleod upon the ground that if engaged in that expedition he did but fulfill the orders of his government , has thus been answered in the only way in which she could be answered by a government the powers of which are distributed among its several departments by the fundamental law .
happily for the people of great britain , as well as those of the united states , the only mode by which an individual arraigned for a criminal offense before the courts of either can obtain his discharge is by the independent action of the judiciary and by proceedings equally familiar to the courts of both countries .
if in great britain a power exists in the crown to cause to be entered a nolle prosequi , which is not the case with the executive power of the united states upon a prosecution pending in a state court , yet there no more than here can the chief executive power rescue a prisoner from custody without an order of the proper tribunal directing his discharge .
the precise stage of the proceedings at which such order may be made is a matter of municipal regulation exclusively , and not to be complained of by any other government .
in cases of this kind a government becomes politically responsible only when its tribunals of last resort are shown to have rendered unjust and injurious judgments in matters not doubtful .
to the establishment and elucidation of this principle no nation has lent its authority more efficiently than great britain .
alexander mcleod , having his option either to prosecute a writ of error from the decision of the supreme court of new york , which had been rendered upon his application for a discharge , to the supreme court of the united states , or to submit his case to the decision of a jury , preferred the latter , deeming it the readiest mode of obtaining his liberation ; and the result has fully sustained the wisdom of his choice .
the manner in which the issue submitted was tried will satisfy the english government that the principles of justice will never fail to govern the enlightened decision of an american tribunal .
i can not fail , however , to suggest to congress the propriety , and in some degree the necessity , of making such provisions by law , so far as they may constitutionally do so , for the removal at their commencement and at the option of the party of all such cases as may hereafter arise , and which may involve the faithful observance and execution of our international obligations , from the state to the federal judiciary .
this government , by our institutions , is charged with the maintenance of peace and the preservation of amicable relations with the nations of the earth , and ought to possess without question all the reasonable and proper means of maintaining the one and preserving the other .
while just confidence is felt in the judiciary of the states , yet this government ought to be competent in itself for the fulfillment of the high duties which have been devolved upon it under the organic law by the states themselves .
in the month of september a party of armed men from upper canada invaded 
 the territory of the united states and forcibly seized upon the person 
 of one grogan , and under circumstances of great harshness hurriedly carried 
 him beyond the limits of the united states and delivered him np to the 
 authorities of upper canada .
his immediate discharge was ordered by those 
 authorities upon the facts of the case being brought to their knowledge -- a 
 course of procedure which was to have been expected from a nation with 
 whom we are at peace , and which was not more due to the rights of the united 
 states than to its own regard for justice .
the correspondence which passed 
 between the department of state and the british envoy , mr. fox , and with 
 the governor of vermont , as soon as the facts had been made known to this 
 department , are herewith communicated .
i regret that it is not in my power to make known to you an equally satisfactory conclusion in the case of the caroline steamer , with the circumstances connected with the destruction of which , in december , 1837 , by an armed force fitted out in the province of upper canada , you are already made acquainted .
no such atonement as was due for the public wrong done to the united states by this invasion of her territory , so wholly irreconcilable with her rights as an independent power , has yet been made .
in the view taken by this government the inquiry whether the vessel was in the employment of those who were prosecuting an unauthorized war against that province or was engaged by the owner in the business of transporting passengers to and from navy island in hopes of private gain , which was most probably the case , in no degree alters the real question at issue between the two governments .
this government can never concede to any foreign government the power , except in a case of the most urgent and extreme necessity , of invading its territory , either to arrest the persons or destroy the property of those who may have violated the municipal laws of such foreign government or have disregarded their obligations arising under the law of nations .
the territory of the united states must be regarded as sacredly secure against all such invasions until they shall voluntarily acknowledge their inability to acquit themselves of their duties to others .
and in announcing this sentiment i do but affirm a principle which no nation on earth would be more ready to vindicate at all hazards than the people and government of great britain .
if upon a full investigation of all the facts it shall appear that the owner of the caroline was governed by a hostile intent or had made common cause with those who were in the occupancy of navy island , then so far as he is concerned there can be no claim to indemnity for the destruction of his boat which this government would feel itself bound to prosecute , since he would have acted not only in derogation of the rights of great britain , but in clear violation of the laws of the united states ; but that is a question which , however settled , in no manner involves the higher consideration of the violation of territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction .
to recognize it as an admissible practice that each government in its turn , upon any sudden and unauthorized outbreak which , on a frontier the extent of which renders it impossible for either to have an efficient force on every mile of it , and which outbreak , therefore , neither may be able to suppress in a day , may take vengeance into its own hands , and without even a remonstrance , and in the absence of any pressing or overruling necessity may invade the territory of the other , would inevitably lead to results equally to be deplored by both .
when border collisions come to receive the sanction or to be made on the authority of either government general war must be the inevitable result .
while it is the ardent desire of the united states to cultivate the relations of peace with all nations and to fulfill all the duties of good neighborhood toward those who possess territories adjoining their own , that very desire would lead them to deny the right of any foreign power to invade their boundary with an armed force .
the correspondence between the two governments on this subject will at a future day of your session be submitted to your consideration ; and in the meantime i can not but indulge the hope that the british government will see the propriety of renouncing as a rule of future action the precedent which has been set in the affair at schlosser .
i herewith submit the correspondence which has recently taken place between the american minister at the court of st. james , mr. stevenson , and the minister of foreign affairs of that government on the right claimed by that government to visit and detain vessels sailing under the american flag and engaged in prosecuting lawful commerce in the african seas .
our commercial interests in that region have experienced considerable increase and have become an object of much importance , and it is the duty of this government to protect them against all improper and vexatious interruption .
however desirous the united states may be for the suppression of the slave trade , they can not consent to interpolations into the maritime code at the mere will and pleasure of other governments .
we deny the right of any such interpolation to any one or all the nations of the earth without our consent .
we claim to have a voice in all amendments or alterations of that code , and when we are given to understand , as in this instance , by a foreign government that its treaties with other nations can not be executed without the establishment and enforcement of new principles of maritime police , to be applied without our consent , we must employ a language neither of equivocal import or susceptible of misconstruction .
american citizens prosecuting a lawful commerce in the african seas under the flag of their country are not responsible for the abuse or unlawful use of that flag by others ; nor can they rightfully on account of any such alleged abuses be interrupted , molested , or detained while on the ocean , and if thus molested and detained while pursuing honest voyages in the usual way and violating no law themselves they are unquestionably entitled to indemnity .
this government has manifested its repugnance to the slave trade in a manner which can not be misunderstood .
by its fundamental law it prescribed limits in point of time to its continuance , and against its own citizens who might so far forget the rights of humanity as to engage in that wicked traffic it has long since by its municipal laws denounced the most condign punishment .
many of the states composing this union had made appeals to the civilized world for its suppression long before the moral sense of other nations had become shocked by the iniquities of the traffic .
whether this government should now enter into treaties containing mutual stipulations upon this subject is a question for its mature deliberation .
certain it is that if the right to detain american ships on the high seas can be justified on the plea of a necessity for such detention arising out of the existence of treaties between other nations , the same plea may , be extended and enlarged by the new stipulations of new treaties to which the united states may not be a party .
this government will not cease to urge upon that of great britain full and ample remuneration for all losses , whether arising from detention or otherwise , to which american citizens have heretofore been or may hereafter be subjected by the exercise of rights which this government can not recognize as legitimate and proper .
nor will i indulge a doubt but that the sense of justice of great britain will constrain her to make retribution for any wrong or loss which any american citizen engaged in the prosecution of lawful commerce may have experienced at the hands of her cruisers or other public authorities .
this government , at the same time , will relax no effort to prevent its citizens , if there be any so disposed , from prosecuting a traffic so revolting to the feelings of humanity .
it seeks to do no more than to protect the fair and honest trader from molestation and injury ; but while the enterprising mariner engaged in the pursuit of an honorable trade is entitled to its protection , it will visit with condign punishment others of an opposite character .
i invite your attention to existing laws for the suppression of the african slave trade , and recommend all such alterations as may give to them greater force and efficacy .
that the american flag is grossly abused by the abandoned and profligate of other nations is but too probable .
congress has not long since had this subject under its consideration , and its importance well justifies renewed and anxious attention .
i also communicate herewith the copy of a correspondence between mr. stevenson and lord palmerston upon the subject , so interesting to several of the southern states , of the rice duties , which resulted honorably to the justice of great britain and advantageously to the united states .
at the opening of the last annual session the president informed congress of the progress which had then been made in negotiating a convention between this government and that of england with a view to the final settlement of the question of the boundary between the territorial limits of the two countries .
i regret to say that little further advancement of the object has been accomplished since last year , but this is owing to circumstances no way indicative of any abatement of the desire of both parties to hasten the negotiation to its conclusion and to settle the question in dispute as early as possible .
in the course of the session it is my hope to be able to announce some further degree of progress toward the accomplishment of this highly desirable end .
the commission appointed by this government for the exploration and survey of the line of boundary separating the states of maine and new hampshire from the conterminous british provinces is , it is believed , about to close its field labors and is expected soon to report the results of its examinations to the department of state .
the report , when received , will be laid before congress .
the failure on the part of spain to pay with punctuality the interest due under the convention of 1834 for the settlement of claims between the two countries has made it the duty of the executive to call the particular attention of that government to the subject .
a disposition has been manifested by it , which is believed to be entirely sincere , to fulfill its obligations in this respect so soon as its internal condition and the state of its finances will permit .
an arrangement is in progress from the result of which it is trusted that those of our citizens who have claims under the convention will at no distant day receive the stipulated payments .
a treaty of commerce and navigation with belgium was concluded and signed at washington on the 29th of march , 1840 , and was duly sanctioned by the senate of the united states .
the treaty was ratified by his belgian majesty , but did not receive the approbation of the belgian chambers within the time limited by its terms , and has therefore become void .
this occurrence assumes the graver aspect from the consideration that in 1833 a treaty negotiated between the two governments and ratified on the part of the united states failed to be ratified on the part of belgium .
the representative of that government at washington informs the department of state that he has been instructed to give explanations of the causes which occasioned delay in the approval of the late treaty by the legislature , and to express the regret of the king at the occurrence .
the joint commission under the convention with texas to ascertain the true boundary between the two countries has concluded its labors , but the final report of the commissioner of the united states has not been received .
it is understood , however , that the meridian line as traced by the commission lies somewhat farther east than the position hitherto generally assigned to it , and consequently includes in texas some part of the territory which had been considered as belonging to the states of louisiana and arkansas .
the united states can not but take a deep interest in whatever relates to this young but growing republic .
settled principally by emigrants from the united states , we have the happiness to know that the great principles of civil liberty are there destined to flourish under wise institutions and wholesome laws , and that through its example another evidence is to be afforded of the capacity of popular institutions to advance the prosperity , happiness , and permanent glory of the human race .
the great truth that government was made for the people and not the people for government has already been established in the practice and by the example of these united states , and we can do no other than contemplate its further exemplification by a sister republic with the deepest interest .
our relations with the independent states of this hemisphere , formerly under the dominion of spain , have not undergone any material change within the past year .
the incessant sanguinary conflicts in or between those countries are to be greatly deplored as necessarily tending to disable them from performing their duty as members of the community of nations and rising to the destiny which the position and natural resources of many of them might lead them justly to anticipate , as constantly giving occasion also , directly or indirectly , for complaints on the part of our citizens who resort thither for purposes of commercial intercourse , and as retarding reparation for wrongs already committed , some of which are by no means of recent date .
the failure of the congress of ecuador to hold a session at the time appointed for that purpose , in january last , will probably render abortive a treaty of commerce with that republic , which was signed at quito on the 13th of june , 1839 , and had been duly ratified on our part , but which required the approbation of that body prior to its ratification by the ecuadorian executive .
a convention which has been concluded with the republic of peru , providing for the settlement of certain claims of citizens of the united states upon the government of that republic , will be duly submitted to the senate .
the claims of our citizens against the brazilian government originating from captures and other causes are still unsatisfied .
the united states have , however , so uniformly shown a disposition to cultivate relations of amity with that empire that it is hoped the unequivocal tokens of the same spirit toward us which an adjustment of the affairs referred to would afford will be given without further avoidable delay .
the war with the indian tribes on the peninsula of florida has during the last summer and fall been prosecuted with untiring activity and zeal .
a summer campaign was resolved upon as the best mode of bringing it to a close .
our brave officers and men who have been engaged in that service have suffered toils and privations and exhibited an energy which in any other war would have won for them unfading laurels .
in despite of the sickness incident to the climate , they have penetrated the fastnesses of the indians , broken up their encampments , and harassed them unceasingly .
numbers have been captured , and still greater numbers have surrendered and have been transported to join their brethren on the lands elsewhere allotted to them by the government , and a strong hope is entertained that under the conduct of the gallant officer at the head of the troops in florida that troublesome and expensive war is destined to a speedy termination .
with all the other indian tribes we are enjoying the blessings of peace .
our duty as well as our best interests prompts us to observe in all our intercourse with them fidelity in fulfilling our engagements , the practice of strict justice , as well as the constant exercise of acts of benevolence and kindness .
these are the great instruments of civilization , and through the use of them alone can the untutored child of the forest be induced to listen to its teachings .
the secretary of state , on whom the acts of congress have devolved the duty of directing the proceedings for the taking of the sixth census or enumeration of the inhabitants of the united states , will report to the two houses the progress of that work .
the enumeration of persons has been completed , and exhibits a grand total of 17,069,453 , making an increase over the census of 1830 of 4,202,646 inhabitants , and showing a gain in a ratio exceeding 32 1/2 per cent for the last ten years .
from the report of the secretary of the treasury you will be informed of the condition of the finances .
the balance in the treasury on the 1st of january last , as stated in the report of the secretary of the treasury submitted to congress at the extra session , was $ 987,345.03 .
the receipts into the treasury during the first three quarters of this year from all sources amount to $ 23,467,072.52 ; the estimated receipts for the fourth quarter amount to $ 6,943,095.25 , amounting to $ 30,410,167.77 , and making with the balance in the treasury on the 1st of january last $ 31,397,512.80 .
the expenditures for the first three quarters of this year amount to $ 24,734,346.97 .
the expenditures for the fourth quarter as estimated will amount to $ 7,290,723.73 , thus making a total of $ 32,025,070.70 , and leaving a deficit to be provided for on the 1st of january next of about $ 627,557.90 .
of the loan of $ 12,000,000 which was authorized by congress at its late session only $ 5,432,726.88 have been negotiated .
the shortness of time which it had to run has presented no inconsiderable impediment in the way of its being taken by capitalists at home , while the same cause would have operated with much greater force in the foreign market .
for that reason the foreign market has not been resorted to ; and it is now submitted whether it would not be advisable to amend the law by making what remains undisposed of payable at a more distant day .
should it be necessary , in any view that congress may take of the subject , to revise the existing tariff of duties , i beg leave to say that in the performance of that most delicate operation moderate counsels would seem to be the wisest .
the government under which it is our happiness to live owes its existence to the spirit of compromise which prevailed among its framers ; jarring and discordant opinions could only have been reconciled by that noble spirit of patriotism which prompted conciliation and resulted in harmony .
in the same spirit the compromise bill , as it is commonly called , was adopted at the session of 1833 .
while the people of no portion of the union will ever hesitate to pay all necessary taxes for the support of government , yet an innate repugnance exists to the imposition of burthens not really necessary for that object .
in imposing duties , however , for the purposes of revenue a right to discriminate as to the articles on which the duty shall be laid , as well as the amount , necessarily and most properly exists ; otherwise the government would be placed in the condition of having to levy the same duties upon all articles , the productive as well as the unproductive .
the slightest duty upon some might have the effect of causing their importation to cease , whereas others , entering extensively into the consumption of the country , might bear the heaviest without any sensible diminution in the amount imported .
so also the government may be justified in so discriminating by reference to other considerations of domestic policy connected with our manufactures .
so long as the duties shall be laid with distinct reference to the wants of the treasury no well - rounded objection can exist against them .
it might be esteemed desirable that no such augmentation of the taxes should take place as would have the effect of annulling the land - proceeds distribution act of the last session , which act is declared to be inoperative the moment the duties are increased beyond 20 per cent , the maximum rate established by the compromise act .
some of the provisions of the compromise act , which will go into effect on the 30th day of june next , may , however , be found exceedingly inconvenient in practice under any regulations that congress may adopt .
i refer more particularly to that relating to the home valuation .
a difference in value of the same articles to some extent will necessarily exist at different ports , but that is altogether insignificant when compared with the conflicts in valuation which are likely to arise from the differences of opinion among the numerous appraisers of merchandise .
in many instances the estimates of value must be conjectural , and thus as many different rates of value may be established as there are appraisers .
these differences in valuation may also be increased by the inclination which , without the slightest imputation on their honesty , may arise on the part of the appraisers in favor of their respective ports of entry .
i recommend this whole subject to the consideration of congress with a single additional remark .
certainty and permanency in any system of governmental policy are in all respects eminently desirable , but more particularly is this true in all that affects trade and commerce , the operations of which depend much more on the certainty of their returns and calculations which embrace distant periods of time than on high bounties or duties , which are liable to constant fluctuations .
at your late session i invited your attention to the condition of the currency and exchanges and urged the necessity of adopting such measures as were consistent with the constitutional competency of the government in order to correct the unsoundness of the one and , as far as practicable , the inequalities of the other .
no country can be in the enjoyment of its full measure of prosperity without the presence of a medium of exchange approximating to uniformity of value .
what is necessary as between the different nations of the earth is also important as between the inhabitants of different parts of the same country .
with the first the precious metals constitute the chief medium of circulation , and such also would be the case as to the last but for inventions comparatively modern , which have furnished in place of gold and silver a paper circulation .
i do not propose to enter into a comparative analysis of the merits of the two systems .
such belonged more properly to the period of the introduction of the paper system .
the speculative philosopher might find inducements to prosecute the inquiry , but his researches could only lead him to conclude that the paper system had probably better never have been introduced and that society might have been much happier without it .
the practical statesman has a very different task to perform .
he has to look at things as they are , to take them as he finds them , to supply deficiencies and to prune excesses as far as in him lies .
the task of furnishing a corrective for derangements of the paper medium with us is almost inexpressibly great .
the power exerted by the states to charter banking corporations , and which , having been carried to a great excess , has filled the country with , in most of the states , an irredeemable paper medium , is an evil which in some way or other requires a corrective .
the rates at which bills of exchange are negotiated between different parts of the country furnish an index of the value of the local substitute for gold and silver , which is in many parts so far depreciated as not to be received except at a large discount in payment of debts or in the purchase of produce .
it could earnestly be desired that every bank not possessing the means of resumption should follow the example of the late united states bank of pennsylvania and go into liquidation rather than by refusing to do so to continue embarrassments in the way of solvent institutions , thereby augmenting the difficulties incident to the present condition of things .
whether this government , with due regard to the rights of the states , has any power to constrain the banks either to resume specie payments or to force them into liquidation , is an inquiry which will not fail to claim your consideration .
in view of the great advantages which are allowed the corporators , not among the least of which is the authority contained in most of their charters to make loans to three times the amount of their capital , thereby often deriving three times as much interest on the same amount of money as any individual is permitted by law to receive , no sufficient apology can be urged for a long - continued suspension of specie payments .
such suspension is productive of the greatest detriment to the public by expelling from circulation the precious metals and seriously hazarding the success of any effort that this government can make to increase commercial facilities and to advance the public interests .
this is the more to be regretted and the indispensable necessity for a sound currency becomes the more manifest when we reflect on the vast amount of the internal commerce of the country .
of this we have no statistics nor just data for forming adequate opinions .
but there can be no doubt but that the amount of transportation coastwise by sea , and the transportation inland by railroads and canals , and by steamboats and other modes of conveyance over the surface of our vast rivers and immense lakes , and the value of property carried and interchanged by these means form a general aggregate to which the foreign commerce of the country , large as it is , makes but a distant approach .
in the absence of any controlling power over this subject , which , by forcing a general resumption of specie payments , would at once have the effect of restoring a sound medium of exchange and would leave to the country but little to desire , what measure of relief falling within the limits of our constitutional competency does it become this government to adopt ?
it was my painful duty at your last session , under the weight of most solemn obligations , to differ with congress on the measures which it proposed for my approval , and which it doubtless regarded as corrective of existing evils .
subsequent reflection and events since occurring have only served to confirm me in the opinions then entertained and frankly expressed .
i must be permitted to add that no scheme of governmental policy unaided by individual exertions can be available for ameliorating the present condition of things .
commercial modes of exchange and a good currency are but the necessary means of commerce and intercourse , not the direct productive sources of wealth .
wealth can only be accumulated by the earnings of industry and the savings of frugality , and nothing can be more ill judged than to look to facilities in borrowing or to a redundant circulation for the power of discharging pecuniary obligations .
the country is full of resources and the people fall of energy , and the great and permanent remedy for present embarrassments must be sought in industry , economy , the observance of good faith , and the favorable influence of time .
in pursuance of a pledge given to you in my last message to congress , which pledge i urge as an apology for adventuring to present you the details of any plan , the secretary of the treasury will be ready to submit to you , should you require it , a plan of finance which , while it throws around the public treasure reasonable guards for its protection and rests on powers acknowledged in practice to exist from the origin of the government , will at the same time furnish to the country a sound paper medium and afford all reasonable facilities for regulating the exchanges .
when submitted , you will perceive in it a plan amendatory of the existing laws in relation to the treasury department , subordinate in all respects to the will of congress directly and the will of the people indirectly , self - sustaining should it be found in practice to realize its promises in theory , and repealable at the pleasure of congress .
it proposes by effectual restraints and by invoking the true spirit of our institutions to separate the purse from the sword , or , more properly to speak , denies any other control to the president over the agents who may be selected to carry it into execution but what may be indispensably necessary to secure the fidelity of such agents , and by wise regulations keeps plainly apart from each other private and public funds .
it contemplates the establishment of a board of control at the seat of government , with agencies at prominent commercial points or wherever else congress shall direct , for the safe - keeping and disbursement of the public moneys and a substitution at the option of the public creditor of treasury notes in lieu of gold and silver .
it proposes to limit the issues to an amount not to exceed $ 15,000,000 without the express sanction of the legislative power .
it also authorizes the receipt of individual deposits of gold and silver to a limited amount , and the granting certificates of deposit divided into such sums as may be called for by the depositors .
it proceeds a step further and authorizes the purchase and sale of domestic bills and drafts resting on a real and substantial basis , payable at sight or having but a short time to run , and drawn on places not less than 100 miles apart , which authority , except in so far as may be necessary for government purposes exclusively , is only to be exerted upon the express condition that its exercise shall not be prohibited by the state in which the agency is situated .
in order to cover the expenses incident to the plan , it will be authorized to receive moderate premiums for certificates issued on deposits and on bills bought and sold , and thus , as far as its dealings extend , to furnish facilities to commercial intercourse at the lowest possible rates and to subduct from the earnings of industry the least possible sum .
it uses the state banks at a distance from the agencies as auxiliaries without imparting any power to trade in its name .
it is subjected to such guards and restraints as have appeared to be necessary .
it is the creature of law and exists only at the pleasure of the legislature .
it is made to rest on an actual specie basis in order to redeem the notes at the places of issue , produces no dangerous redundancy of circulation , affords no temptation to speculation , is attended by no inflation of prices , is equable in its operation , makes the treasury notes ( which it may use along with the certificates of deposit and the notes of specie - paying banks ) convertible at the place where collected , receivable in payment of government dues , and without violating any principle of the constitution affords the government and the people such facilities as are called for by the wants of both .
such , it has appeared to me , are its recommendations , and in view of them it will be submitted , whenever you may require it , to your consideration .
i am not able to perceive that any fair and candid objection can be urged against the plan , the principal outlines of which i have thus presented .
i can not doubt but that the notes which it proposes to furnish at the voluntary option of the public creditor , issued in lieu of the revenue and its certificates of deposit , will be maintained at an equality with gold and silver everywhere .
they are redeemable in gold and silver on demand at the places of issue .
they are receivable everywhere in payment of government dues .
the treasury notes are limited to an amount of one - fourth less than the estimated annual receipts of the treasury , and in addition they rest upon the faith of the government for their redemption .
if all these assurances are not sufficient to make them available , then the idea , as it seems to me , of furnishing a sound paper medium of exchange may be entirely abandoned .
if a fear be indulged that the government may be tempted to run into excess in its issues at any future day , it seems to me that no such apprehension can reasonably be entertained until all confidence in the representatives of the states and of the people , as well as of the people themselves , shall be lost .
the weightiest considerations of policy require that the restraints now proposed to be thrown around the measure should not for light causes be removed .
to argue against any proposed plan its liability to possible abuse is to reject every expedient , since everything dependent on human action is liable to abuse .
fifteen millions of treasury notes may be issued as the maximum , but a discretionary power is to be given to the board of control under that sum , and every consideration will unite in leading them to feel their way with caution .
for the first eight years of the existence of the late bank of the united states its circulation barely exceeded $ 4,000,000 , and for five of its most prosperous years it was about equal to $ 16,000,000 ; furthermore , the authority given to receive private deposits to a limited amount and to issue certificates in such sums as may be called for by the depositors may so far fill up the channels of circulation as greatly to diminish the necessity of any considerable issue of treasury notes .
a restraint upon the amount of private deposits has seemed to be indispensably necessary from an apprehension , thought to be well founded , that in any emergency of trade confidence might be so far shaken in the banks as to induce a withdrawal from them of private deposits with a view to insure their unquestionable safety when deposited with the government , which might prove eminently disastrous to the state banks .
is it objected that it is proposed to authorize the agencies to deal in bills of exchange ?
it is answered that such dealings are to be carried on at the lowest possible premium , are made to rest on an unquestionably sound basis , are designed to reimburse merely the expenses which would otherwise devolve upon the treasury , and are in strict subordination to the decision of the supreme court in the case of the bank of augusta against earle , and other reported cases , and thereby avoids all conflict with state jurisdiction , which i hold to be indispensably requisite .
it leaves the banking privileges of the states without interference , looks to the treasury and the union , and while furnishing every facility to the first is careful of the interests of the last .
but above all , it is created by law , is amendable by law , and is repealable by law , and , wedded as i am to no theory , but looking solely to the advancement of the public good , i shall be among the very first to urge its repeal if it be found not to subserve the purposes and objects for which it may be created .
nor will the plan be submitted in any overweening confidence in the sufficiency of my own judgment , but with much greater reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of congress .
i can not abandon this subject without urging upon you in the most emphatic manner , whatever may be your action on the suggestions which i have felt it to be my duty to submit , to relieve the chief executive magistrate , by any and all constitutional means , from a controlling power over the public treasury .
if in the plan proposed , should you deem it worthy of your consideration , that separation is not as complete as you may desire , you will doubtless amend it in that particular .
for myself , i disclaim all desire to have any control over the public moneys other than what is indispensably necessary to execute the laws which you may pass .
nor can i fail to advert in this connection to the debts which many of the states of the union have contracted abroad and under which they continue to labor .
that indebtedness amounts to a sum not less than $ 200,000,000 , and which has been retributed to them for the most part in works of internal improvement which are destined to prove of vast importance in ultimately advancing their prosperity and wealth .
for the debts thus contracted the states are alone responsible .
i can do not more than express the belief that each state will feel itself bound by every consideration of honor as well as of interest to meet its engagements with punctuality .
the failure , however , of any one state to do so should in no degree affect the credit of the rest , and the foreign capitalist will have no just cause to experience alarm as to all other state stocks because any one or more of the states may neglect to provide with punctuality the means of redeeming their engagements .
even such states , should there be any , considering the great rapidity with which their resources are developing themselves , will not fail to have the means at no very distant day to redeem their obligations to the uttermost farthing ; nor will i doubt but that , in view of that honorable conduct which has evermore governed the states and the people of the union , they will each and all resort to every legitimate expedient before they will forego a faithful compliance with their obligations .
from the report of the secretary of war and other reports accompanying it you will be informed of the progress which has been made in the fortifications designed for the protection of our principal cities , roadsteads , and inland frontier during the present year , together with their true state and condition .
they will be prosecuted to completion with all the expedition which the means placed by congress at the disposal of the executive will allow .
i recommend particularly to your consideration that portion of the secretary 's report which proposes the establishment of a chain of military posts from council bluffs to some point on the pacific ocean within our limits .
the benefit thereby destined to accrue to our citizens engaged in the fur trade over that wilderness region , added to the importance of cultivating friendly relations with savage tribes inhabiting it , and at the same time of giving protection to our frontier settlements and of establishing the means of safe intercourse between the american settlements at the mouth of the columbia river and those on this side of the rocky mountains , would seem to suggest the importance of carrying into effect the recommendations upon this head with as little delay as may be practicable .
the report of the secretary of the navy will place you in possession of the present condition of that important arm of the national defense .
every effort will be made to add to its efficiency , and i can not too strongly urge upon you liberal appropriations to that branch of the public service .
inducements of the weightiest character exist for the adoption of this course of policy .
our extended and otherwise exposed maritime frontier calls for protection , to the furnishing of which an efficient naval force is indispensable .
we look to no foreign conquests , nor do we propose to enter into competition with any other nation for supremacy on the ocean ; but it is due not only to the honor but to the security of the people of the united states that no nation should be permitted to invade our waters at pleasure and subject our towns and villages to conflagration or pillage .
economy in all branches of the public service is due from all the public agents to the people , but parsimony alone would suggest the withholding of the necessary means for the protection of our domestic firesides from invasion and our national honor from disgrace .
i would most earnestly recommend to congress to abstain from all appropriations for objects not absolutely necessary ; but i take upon myself , without a moment of hesitancy , all the responsibility of recommending the increase and prompt equipment of that gallant navy which has lighted up every sea with its victories and spread an imperishable glory over the country .
the report of the postmaster - general will claim your particular attention , not only because of the valuable suggestions which it contains , but because of the great importance which at all times attaches to that interesting branch of the public service .
the increased expense of transporting the mail along the principal routes necessarily claims the public attention , and has awakened a corresponding solicitude on the part of the government .
the transmission of the mail must keep pace with those facilities of intercommunication which are every day becoming greater through the building of railroads and the application of steam power , but it can not be disguised that in order to do so the post - office department is subjected to heavy exactions .
the lines of communication between distant parts of the union are to a great extent occupied by railroads , which , in the nature of things , possess a complete monopoly , and the department is therefore liable to heavy and unreasonable charges .
this evil is destined to great increase in future , and some timely measure may become necessary to guard against it .
i feel it my duty to bring under your consideration a practice which has grown up in the administration of the government , and which , i am deeply convinced , ought to be corrected .
i allude to the exercise of the power which usage rather than reason has vested in the presidents of removing incumbents from office in order to substitute others more in favor with the dominant party .
my own conduct in this respect has been governed by a conscientious purpose to exercise the removing power only in cases of unfaithfulness or inability , or in those in which its exercise appeared necessary in order to discountenance and suppress that spirit of active partisanship on the part of holders of office which not only withdraws them from the steady and impartial discharge of their official duties , but exerts an undue and injurious influence over elections and degrades the character of the government itself , inasmuch as it exhibits the chief magistrate as being a party through his agents in the secret plots or open workings of political parties .
in respect to the exercise of this power nothing should be left to discretion which may safely be regulated by law , and it is of high importance to restrain as far as possible the stimulus of personal interests in public elections .
considering the great increase which has been made in public offices in the last quarter of a century and the probability of further increase , we incur the hazard of witnessing violent political contests , directed too often to the single object of retaining office by those who are in or obtaining it by those who are out .
under the influence of these convictions i shall cordially concur in any constitutional measure for regulating and , by regulating , restraining the power of removal .
i suggest for your consideration the propriety of making without further delay some specific application of the funds derived under the will of mr. smithson , of england , for the diffusion of knowledge , and which have heretofore been vested in public stocks until such time as congress should think proper to give them a specific direction .
nor will you , i feel confident , permit any abatement of the principal of the legacy to be made should it turn out that the stocks in which the investments have been made have undergone a depreciation .
in conclusion i commend to your care the interests of this district , for which you are the exclusive legislators .
considering that this city is the residence of the government and for a large part of the year of congress , and considering also the great cost of the public buildings and the propriety of affording them at all times careful protection , it seems not unreasonable that congress should contribute toward the expense of an efficient police .

to the senate of the united states : 
 i transmit to the senate , for its consideration with a view to its ratification , a treaty of amity , commerce , and navigation with the republic of texas , negotiated at the seat of government of the united states between the secretary of state , duly empowered for that purpose , and the charge ' d'affaires of that republic .
in forming the first commercial treaty between the two governments an anxious desire has been felt to introduce such provisions as should promote the interests of both countries .
the immediate proximity of texas to the united states and the consequent facility of intercourse , the nature of its principal agricultural production , and the relations which both countries bear to several large rivers which are boundaries between them , and which in some part of their course run within the territories of both , have caused peculiarities of condition and interests which it has been necessary to guard .
the treaty provides that texas shall enjoy a right of deposit for such of her productions as may be introduced into the united states for exportation , but upon the condition that the executive of the united states may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the proper enjoyment of the privilege within our territory .
it was thought no more than reasonable to grant this facility to the trade of texas , under such conditions as seem best calculated to guard against abuse or inconvenience .
the treaty further provides that raw cotton may be imported from either country into the other free of duties .
in general it is not wise to enter into treaty stipulations respecting duties of import ; they are usually much better left to the operation of general laws .
but there are circumstances existing in this case which have been thought to justify a departure from the general rule , and the addition of it to the number of instances , not large , in which regulations of duties of imports have been made the subject of national compact .
the united states consume large quantities of raw cotton , but they are exporters of the article to a still greater extent .
texas , for the present at least , exports her whole crop .
these exportations are , in general , to the same foreign markets , and it is supposed to be of no considerable importance to the american producer whether he meets the texan product at home or abroad .
on the other hand , it is thought that a useful commercial intercourse would be promoted in several ways by receiving the raw cotton of texas at once into the united states free of duty .
the tendency of such a measure is to bring to the united states , in the first instance , texan cotton ultimately destined to european markets .
the natural effect of this , it is supposed , will be to increase the business of the cities of the united states to the extent of this importation and exportation , and to secure a further degree of employment to the navigation of the country .
but these are by no means all the benefits which may be reasonably expected from the arrangement .
texas , at least for a considerable time to come , must import all the manufactured articles and much of the supplies and provisions necessary for her use and consumption .
these commodities she will be likely to obtain , if to be had , in the markets of the country in which she disposes of her main annual product .
the manufactures of the north and east , therefore , and the grain and provisions of the western states are likely to find in texas a demand , increased by whatever augments intercourse between the two countries , and especially by whatever tends to give attraction to the cities of the united states as marts for the sale of her great and principal article of export .
as a security ; however , against unforeseen results or occurrences , it has been thought advisable to give this article of the treaty a limitation of five years .

to the senate and house of representatives .
the season for active hostilities in florida having nearly terminated , my attention has necessarily been directed to the course of measures to be pursued hereafter in relation to the few indians yet remaining in that territory .
their number is believed not to exceed 240 , of whom there are supposed to be about 80 warriors , or males capable of bearing arms .
the further pursuit of these miserable beings by a large military force seems to be as injudicious as it is unavailing .
the history of the last year 's campaign in florida has satisfactorily shown that notwithstanding the vigorous and incessant operations of our troops ( which can not be exceeded ) , the indian mode of warfare , their dispersed condition , and the very smallness of their number ( which increases the difficulty of finding them in the abundant and almost inaccessible hiding places of the territory ) render any further attempt to secure them by force impracticable except by the employment of the most expensive means .
the exhibition of force and the constant efforts to capture or destroy them of course places them beyond the reach of overtures to surrender .
it is believed by the distinguished officer in command there that a different system should now be pursued to attain the entire removal of all the indians in florida , and he recommends that hostilities should cease unless the renewal of them be rendered necessary by new aggressions ; that communications should be opened by means of the indians with him to insure them a peaceful and voluntary surrender , and that the military operations should hereafter be directed to the protection of the inhabitants .
these views are strengthened and corroborated by the governor of the territory , by many of its most intelligent citizens , and by numerous officers of the army who have served and are still serving in that region .
mature reflection has satisfied me that these recommendations are sound and just ; and i rejoice that consistently with duty to florida i may indulge my desire to promote the great interests of humanity and extend the reign of peace and good will by terminating the unhappy warfare that has so long been carried on there , and at the same time gratify my anxiety to reduce the demands upon the treasury by curtailing the extraordinary expenses which have attended the contest .
i have therefore authorized the colonel in command there as soon as he shall deem it expedient to declare that hostilities against the indians have ceased , and that they will not be renewed unless provoked and rendered indispensable by new outrages on their part , but that neither citizens nor troops are to be restrained from any necessary and proper acts of self - defense against any attempts to molest them .
he is instructed to open communications with those yet remaining , and endeavor by all peaceable means to persuade them to consult their true interests by joining their brethren at the west ; and directions have been given for establishing a cordon or line of protection for the inhabitants by the necessary number of troops .
but to render this system of protection effectual it is essential that settlements of our citizens should be made within the line so established , and that they should be armed , so as to be ready to repel any attack .
in order to afford inducements to such settlements , i submit to the consideration of congress the propriety of allowing a reasonable quantity of land to the head of each family that shall permanently occupy it , and of extending the existing provisions on that subject so as to permit the issue of rations for the subsistence of the settlers for one year ; and as few of them will probably be provided with arms , it would be expedient to authorize the loan of muskets and the delivery of a proper quantity of cartridges or of powder and balls .
by such means it is to be hoped that a hardy population will soon occupy the rich soil of the frontiers of florida , who will be as capable as willing to defend themselves and their houses , and thus relieve the government from further anxiety or expense for their protection .
