mr. president , mr. secretary general , your excellencies : in 1946 , president harry truman welcomed representatives of 55 nations to the first general assembly of the united nations .
since then , every american president has had the great honor of addressing this assembly .
today , with pleasure and humility , i take my turn in welcoming you , the distinguished representatives of 138 nations .
when i took office , i told the american people that my remarks would be " just a little straight talk among friends . "
straight talk is what i propose here today in the first of my addresses to the representatives of the world .
next week , secretary of state henry kissinger will present in specifics the overall principles which i will outline in my remarks today .
it should be emphatically understood that the secretary of state has my full support and the unquestioned backing of the american people .
as a party leader in the congress of the united states , as vice president , and now as president of the united states of america , i have had the closest working relationship with secretary of state kissinger .
i have supported and will continue to endorse his many efforts as secretary of state and in our national security council system to build a world of peace .
since the united nations was rounded , the world has experienced conflicts and threats to peace , but we have avoided the greatest danger -- another world war .
today , we have the opportunity to make the remainder of this century an era of peace and cooperation and economic well - being .
the harsh hostilities which once held great powers in their rigid grasp have now begun to moderate .
many of the crises which dominated past general assemblies are fortunately behind us .
and technological progress holds out the hope that one day all men can achieve a decent life .
nations too often have had no choice but to be either hammer or anvil , to strike or to be struck .
now we have a new opportunity -- to forge , in concert with others , a framework of international cooperation .
that is the course the united states has chosen for itself .
on behalf of the american people , i renew these basic pledges to you today :-- we are committed to a pursuit of a more peaceful , stable , and cooperative world .
while we are determined never to be bested in a test of strength , we will devote our strength to what is best .
and in the nuclear era , there is no rational alternative to accords of mutual restraint between the united states and the soviet union , two nations which have the power to destroy mankind .-- we will bolster our partnerships with traditional friends in europe , asia , and latin america to meet new challenges in a rapidly changing world .
the maintenance of such relationships underpins rather than undercuts the search for peace .-- we will seek out , we will expand our relations with old adversaries .
for example , our new rapport with the people 's republic of china best serves the purposes of each nation and the interests of the entire world .-- we will strive to heal old wounds , reopened in recent conflicts in cyprus , the middle east , and in indochina .
peace can not be imposed from without , but we will do whatever is within our capacity to help achieve it .-- we rededicate ourselves to the search for justice , equality , and freedom .
recent developments in africa signal the welcome end of colonialism .
behavior appropriate to an era of dependence must give way to the new responsibilities of an era of interdependence .
no single nation , no single group of nations , no single organization can meet all of the challenges before the community of nations .
we must act in concert .
progress toward a better world must come through cooperative efforts across the whole range of bilateral and multilateral relations .
america 's revolutionary birth and centuries of experience in adjusting democratic government to changing conditions have made americans practical as well as idealistic .
as idealists , we are proud of our role in the founding of the united nations and in supporting its many accomplishments .
as practical people , we are sometimes impatient at what we see as shortcomings .
in my 25 years as a member of the congress of the united states , i learned two basic , practical lessons : first , men of differing political persuasions can find common ground for cooperation .
we need not agree on all issues in order to agree on most .
differences of principle , of purpose , of perspective , will not disappear .
but neither will our mutual problems disappear unless we are determined to find mutually helpful solutions .
second , a majority must take into account the proper interest of a minority if the decisions of the majority are to be accepted .
we who believe in and live by majority rule must always be alert to the danger of the " tyranny of the majority . "
majority rule thrives on the habits of accommodation , moderation , and consideration of the interests of others .
a very stark reality has tempered america 's actions for decades and must now temper the actions of all nations .
prevention of full - scale warfare in the nuclear age has become everybody 's responsibility .
today 's regional conflict must not become tomorrow 's world disaster .
we must assure by every means at our disposal that local crises are quickly contained and resolved .
the challenge before the united states   is very clear .
this organization can place the weight of the world community on the side of world peace .
and this organization can provide impartial forces to maintain the peace .
and at this point i wish to pay tribute on behalf of the american people to the 37 members of the united nations peacekeeping forces who have given their lives in the middle east and in cyprus in the past 10 months , and i convey our deepest sympathies to their loved ones .
let the quality of our response measure up to the magnitude of the challenge that we face .
i pledge to you that america will continue to be constructive , innovative , and responsive to the work of this great body .
the nations in this hall are united by a deep concern for peace .
we are united as well by our desire to ensure a better life for all people .
today , the economy of the world is under unprecedented stress .
we need new approaches to international cooperation to respond effectively to the problems that we face .
developing and developed countries , market and nonmarket countries - we are all a part of one interdependent economic system .
the food and oil crises demonstrate the extent of our interdependence .
many developing nations need the food surplus of a few developed nations .
and many industrialized nations need the oil production of a few developing nations .
energy is required to produce food and food to produce energy -- and both to provide a decent life for everyone .
the problems of food and energy can be resolved on the basis of cooperation , or can , i should say ,   made unmanageable on the basis of confrontation .
runaway inflation , propelled by food and oil price increases , is an early warning signal to all of us .
let us not delude ourselves .
failure to cooperate on oil and food and inflation could spell disaster for every nation represented in this room .
the united nations must not and need not allow this to occur .
a global strategy for food and energy is urgently required .
the united states believes four principles should guide a global approach : first , all nations must substantially increase production .
just to maintain the present standards of living the world must almost double its output of food and energy to match the expected increase in the world 's population by the end of this century .
to meet aspirations for a better life , production will have to expand at a significantly faster rate than population growth .
second , all nations must seek to achieve a level of prices which not only provides an incentive to producers but which consumers can afford .
it should now be clear that the developed nations are not the only countries which demand and receive an adequate return for their goods .
but it should also be clear that by confronting consumers with production restrictions , artificial pricing , and the prospect of ultimate bankruptcy , producers will eventually become the victims of their own actions .
third , all nations must avoid the abuse of man 's fundamental needs for the sake of narrow national or bloc advantage .
the attempt by any nation to use one commodity for political purposes will inevitably tempt other countries to use their commodities for their own purposes .
fourth , the nations of the world must assure that the poorest among us are not overwhelmed by rising prices of the imports necessary for their survival .
the traditional aid donors and the increasingly wealthy oil producers must join in this effort .
the united states recognizes the special responsibility we bear as the world 's largest producer of food .
that is why secretary of state kissinger proposed from this very podium last year a world food conference to define a global food policy .
and that is one reason why we have removed domestic restrictions on food productions in the united states .
it has not been our policy to use food as a political weapon , despite the oil embargo and recent oil prices and production decisions .
it would be tempting for the united states -- beset by inflation and soaring energy prices -- to turn a deaf ear to external appeals for food assistance , or to respond with internal appeals for export controls .
but however difficult our own economic situation , we recognize that the plight of others is worse .
americans have always responded to human emergencies in the past , and we respond again here today .
in response to secretary general waldheim 's appeal and to help meet the long - term challenge in food , i reiterate : to help developing nations realize their aspirations to grow more of their own food , the united states will substantially increase its assistance to agricultural production programs in other countries .
next , to ensure that the survival of millions of our fellow men does not depend upon the vagaries of weather , the united states is prepared to join in a worldwide effort to negotiate , establish , and maintain an international system of food reserves .
this system will work best if each nation is made responsible for managing the reserves that it will have available .
finally , to make certain that the more immediate needs for food are met this year , the united states will not only maintain the amount it spends for food shipments to nations in need but it will increase this amount this year .
thus , the united states is striving to help define and help contribute to a cooperative global policy to meet man 's immediate and long - term need for food .
we will set forth our comprehensive proposals at the world food conference in november .
now is the time for oil producers to define their conception of a global policy on energy to meet the growing need and to do this without imposing unacceptable burdens on the international monetary and trade system .
a world of economic confrontation can not be a world of political cooperation .
if we fail to satisfy man 's fundamental needs for energy and food , we face a threat not just to our aspirations for a better life for all our peoples but to our hopes for a more stable and a more peaceful world .
by working together to overcome our common problems , mankind can turn from fear towards hope .
from the time of the founding of the united nations , america volunteered to help nations in need , frequently as the main benefactor .
we were able to do it .
we were glad to do it .
but as new economic forces alter and reshape today 's complex world , no nation can be expected to feed all the world 's hungry peoples .
fortunately , however , many nations are increasingly able to help .
and i call on them to join with us as truly united nations in the struggle to produce , to provide more food at lower prices for the hungry and , in general , a better life for the needy of this world .
america will continue to do more than its share .
but there are realistic limits to our capacities .
there is no limit , however , to our determination to act in concert with other nations to fulfill the vision of the united nations charter , to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , and to promote social progress and better standards , better standards of life in a larger freedom .
thank you very , very much .

good evening .
last january 15 , i went before your senators and representatives in congress with a comprehensive plan to make our country independent of foreign sources of energy by 1985 .
such a program was long overdue .
we have become increasingly at the mercy of others for the fuel on which our entire economy runs .
here are the facts and figures that will not go away .
the united states is dependent on foreign sources for about 37 percent of its present petroleum needs .
in ten years , if we do nothing , we will be importing more than half our oil at prices fixed by others -- if they choose to sell to us at all .
in two - and - a - half years , we will be twice as vulnerable to a foreign oil embargo as we were two winters ago .
we are now paying out $ 25 billion a year for foreign oil .
five years ago we paid out only $ 3 billion annually .
five years from now , if we do nothing , who knows how many more billions will be flowing out of the united states .
these are not just american dollars , these are american jobs .
four months ago , i sent the congress this 167-page draft of detailed legislation , plus some additional tax proposals .
my program was designed to conserve the energy we now have , while at the same time speeding up the development and production of new domestic energy .
although this would increase the cost of energy until new supplies were fully tapped , those dollars would remain in this country and would be returned to our own economy through tax cuts and rebates .
i asked the congress in january to enact this urgent 10-year program for energy independence within 90 days -- that is , by mid - april .
in the meantime , to get things going , i said i would use the standby presidential authority granted by the congress to reduce our use of foreign petroleum by raising import fees on each barrel of crude oil by $ 1 on february 1 , another dollar on march 1 , and a third on april 1 .
as soon as congress acted on my comprehensive energy program , i promised to take off these import fees .
i imposed the first dollar on oil imports february 1 , making appropriate exemptions for hardship situations .
now , what did the congress do in february about energy ?
congress did nothing -- nothing , that is , except rush through legislation suspending for 90 days my authority to impose any import fees on foreign oil .
congress needed time , they said .
at the end of february , the democratic leaders of the house and senate and other members concerned with energy came to the white house .
they gave me this pamphlet outlining energy goals similar to mine and promised to come up with a congressional energy program better than mine by the end of april .
i remember one of them saying he did n't see how they could ask the president to do more than postpone the second dollar for 60 days .
if the congress could n't come up with an energy program by then , he said , go ahead and put it on .
their request stretched my original deadline by a couple of weeks .
but i wanted to be reasonable ; i wanted to be cooperative .
so , in vetoing their bill to restrict the president 's authority , i agreed to their request for a 60-day delay before taking the next step under my energy plan .
what did the congress do in march ?
what did the congress do in april about energy ?
congress did nothing .
in fairness , i must say there were diligent efforts by some members -- democrats as well as republicans -- to fashion meaningful energy legislation in their subcommittees and committees .
my administration worked very hard with them to bring a real energy independence bill to a vote .
at the end of april , the deadline set by the congressional leaders themselves , i deferred for still another 30 days , the second $ 1 fee on imported oil .
even then , i still hoped for positive congressional action .
so , what has the congress done in may about energy ?
congress did nothing and went home for a 10-day recess .
february , march , april , may -- as of now , the congress has done nothing positive to end our energy dependence .
on the contrary , it has taken two negative actions : the first , an attempt to prevent the president from doing anything on his own , the second , to pass a strip mining bill which would reduce domestic coal production instead of increasing it , put thousands of people out of work , needlessly increase the cost of energy to consumers , raise electric bills for many , and compel us to import more foreign oil , not less .
i was forced to veto this anti - energy bill last week because i will not be responsible for taking one step backward on energy when the congress will not take one step forward on energy .
the congress has concentrated its attention on conservation measures such as a higher gasoline tax .
the congress has done little or nothing to stimulate production of new energy sources here at home .
at elk hills naval petroleum reserve in california , i saw oil wells waiting to produce 300,000 barrels a day if the congress would change the law to permit it .
there are untold millions of barrels more in our alaskan petroleum reserves and under the continental shelf .
we could save 300,000 barrels a day if only the congress would allow more electric powerplants to substitute american coal for foreign oil .
peaceful atomic power , which we pioneered , is advancing faster abroad than at home .
still the congress does nothing about energy .
we are today worse off than we were in january .
domestic oil production is going down , down , down .
natural gas production is starting to dwindle .
and many areas face severe shortages next winter .
coal production is still at the levels of the 1940 's .
foreign oil suppliers are considering another price increase .
i could go on and on , but you know the facts .
this country needs to regain its independence from foreign sources of energy , and the sooner the better .
there is no visible energy shortage now , but we could have one overnight .
we do not have an energy crisis , but we may have one next winter .
we do have an energy problem , a very grave problem , but one we can still manage and solve if we are successful internationally and can act decisively domestically .
four months are already lost .
the congress has acted only negatively .
i must now do what i can do as president .
first , i will impose an additional $ 1 import fee on foreign crude oil and 60 cents on refined products , effective june 1 .
i gave the congress its 60 days plus an extra 30 days to do something -- but nothing has been done since january .
higher fees will further discourage the consumption of imported fuel and may generate some constructive action when the congress comes back .
second , as i directed on april 30 , the federal energy administration has completed public hearings on decontrol of old domestic oil .
i will submit a decontrol plan to congress shortly after it reconvenes .
along with it , i will urge the congress to pass a windfall profits tax with a plowback provision .
these two measures would prevent unfair gains by oil companies from decontrol prices , furnish a substantial incentive to increase domestic energy production , and encourage conservation .
when i talk about energy , i am talking about jobs .
our american economy runs on energy -- no energy , no jobs .
in the long run , it is just that simple .
the sudden fourfold increase in foreign oil prices and the 1973 embargo helped to throw us into this recession .
we are on our way out of this recession .
another oil embargo could throw us back .
we can not continue to depend on the price and supply whims of others .
the congress can not drift , dawdle , and debate forever with america 's future .
i need your help to energize this congress into comprehensive action .
i will continue to press for my january program , which is still the only total energy program there is .
i can not sit here idly while nothing is done .
we must get on with the job right now .
thank you and good night .

mr. speaker , mr. vice president , members of the 95th congress , and distinguished guests : in accordance with the constitution , i come before you once again to report on the state of the union .
this report will be my last -- maybe --   -- but for the union it is only the first of such reports in our third century of independence , the close of which none of us will ever see .
we can be confident , however , that 100 years from now a freely elected president will come before a freely elected congress chosen to renew our great republic 's pledge to the government of the people , by the people , and for the people .
for my part i pray the third century we are beginning will bring to all americans , our children and their children 's children , a greater measure of individual equality , opportunity , and justice , a greater abundance of spiritual and material blessings , and a higher quality of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
the state of the union is a measurement of the many elements of which it is composed -- a political union of diverse states , an economic union of varying interests , an intellectual union of common convictions , and a moral union of immutable ideals .
taken in sum , i can report that the state of the union is good .
there is room for improvement , as always , but today we have a more perfect union than when my stewardship began .
as a people we discovered that our bicentennial was much more than a celebration of the past ; it became a joyous reaffirmation of all that it means to be americans , a confirmation before all the world of the vitality and durability of our free institutions .
i am proud to have been privileged to preside over the affairs of our federal government during these eventful years when we proved , as i said in my first words upon assuming office , that " our constitution works ; our great republic is a government of laws and not of men .
here the people rule."the people have spoken ; they have chosen a new president and a new congress to work their will .
i congratulate you -- particularly the new members -- as sincerely as i did president - elect carter .
in a few days it will be his duty to outline for you his priorities and legislative recommendations .
tonight i will not infringe on that responsibility , but rather wish him the very best in all that is good for our country .
during the period of my own service in this capitol and in the white house , i can recall many orderly transitions of governmental responsibility -- of problems as well as of position , of burdens as well as of power .
the genius of the american system is that we do this so naturally and so normally .
there are no soldiers marching in the street except in the inaugural parade ; no public demonstrations except for some of the dancers at the inaugural ball ; the opposition party does n't go underground , but goes on functioning vigorously in the congress and in the country ; and our vigilant press goes right on probing and publishing our faults and our follies , confirming the wisdom of the framers of the first amendment .
because of the transfer of authority in our form of government affects the state of the union and of the world , i am happy to report to you that the current transition is proceeding very well .
i was determined that it should ; i wanted the new president to get off on an easier start than i had .
when i became president on august 9 , 1974 , our nation was deeply divided and tormented .
in rapid succession the vice president and the president had resigned in disgrace .
we were still struggling with the after - effects of a long , unpopular , and bloody war in southeast asia .
the economy was unstable and racing toward the worst recession in 40 years .
people were losing jobs .
the cost of living was soaring .
the congress and the chief executive were at loggerheads .
the integrity of our constitutional process and other institutions was being questioned .
for more than 15 years domestic spending had soared as federal programs multiplied , and the expense escalated annually .
during the same period our national security needs were steadily shortchanged .
in the grave situation which prevailed in august 1974 , our will to maintain our international leadership was in doubt .
i asked for your prayers and went to work .
in january 1975 i reported to the congress that the state of the union was not good .
i proposed urgent action to improve the economy and to achieve energy independence in 10 years .
i reassured america 's allies and sought to reduce the danger of confrontation with potential adversaries .
i pledged a new direction for america .
1975 was a year of difficult decisions , but americans responded with realism , common sense , and self - discipline .
by january 1976 we were headed in a new direction , which i hold to be the right direction for a free society .
it was guided by the belief that successful problem - solving requires more than federal action alone , that it involves a full partnership among all branches and all levels of government and public policies which nurture and promote the creative energies of private enterprises , institutions , and individual citizens .
a year ago i reported that the state of the union was better -- in many ways a lot better -- but still not good enough .
common sense told me to stick to the steady course we were on , to continue to restrain the inflationary growth of government , to reduce taxes as well as spending , to return local decisions to local officials , to provide for long - range sufficiency in energy and national security needs .
i resisted the immense pressures of an election year to open the floodgates of federal money and the temptation to promise more than i could deliver .
i told it as it was to the american people and demonstrated to the world that in our spirited political competition , as in this chamber , americans can disagree without being disagreeable .
now , after 30 months as your president , i can say that while we still have a way to go , i am proud of the long way we have come together .
i am proud of the part i have had in rebuilding confidence in the presidency , confidence in our free system , and confidence in our future .
once again , americans believe in themselves , in their leaders , and in the promise that tomorrow holds for their children .
i am proud that today america is at peace .
none of our sons are fighting and dying in battle anywhere in the world .
and the chance for peace among all nations is improved by our determination to honor our vital commitments in defense of peace and freedom .
i am proud that the united states has strong defenses , strong alliances , and a sound and courageous foreign policy .
our alliances with major partners , the great industrial democracies of western europe , japan , and canada , have never been more solid .
consultations on mutual security , defense , and east - west relations have grown closer .
collaboration has branched out into new ' fields such as energy , economic policy , and relations with the third world .
we have used many avenues for cooperation , including summit meetings held among major allied countries .
the friendship of the democracies is deeper , warmer , and more effective than at any time in 30 years .
we are maintaining stability in the strategic nuclear balance and pushing back the specter of nuclear war .
a decisive step forward was taken in the vladivostok accord which i negotiated with general secretary brezhnev -- joint recognition that an equal ceiling should be placed on the number of strategic weapons on each side .
with resolve and wisdom on the part of both nations , a good agreement is well within reach this year .
the framework for peace in the middle east has been built .
hopes for future progress in the middle east were stirred by the historic agreements we reached and the trust and confidence that we formed .
thanks to american leadership , the prospects for peace in the middle east are brighter than they have been in three decades .
the arab states and israel continue to look to us to lead them from confrontation and war to a new era of accommodation and peace .
we have no alternative but to persevere , and i am sure we will .
the opportunities for a final settlement are great , and the price of failure is a return to the bloodshed and hatred that for too long have brought tragedy to all of the peoples of this area and repeatedly edged the world to the brink of war .
our relationship with the people 's republic of china is proving its importance and its durability .
we are finding more and more common ground between our two countries on basic questions of international affairs .
in my two trips to asia as president , we have reaffirmed america 's continuing vital interest in the peace and security of asia and the pacific basin , established a new partnership with japan , confirmed our dedication to the security of korea , and reinforced our ties with the free nations of southeast asia .
an historic dialog has begun between industrial nations and developing nations .
most proposals on the table are the initiatives of the united states , including those on food , energy , technology , trade , investment , and commodities .
we are well launched on this process of shaping positive and reliable economic relations between rich nations and poor nations over the long term .
we have made progress in trade negotiations and avoided protectionism during recession .
we strengthened the international monetary system .
during the past two years the free world 's most important economic powers have already brought about important changes that serve both developed and developing economies .
the momentum already achieved must be nurtured and strengthened , for the prosperity of the rich and poor depends upon it .
in latin america , our relations have taken on a new maturity and a sense of common enterprise .
in africa the quest for peace , racial justice , and economic progress is at a crucial point .
the united states , in close cooperation with the united kingdom , is actively engaged in this historic process .
will change come about by warfare and chaos and foreign intervention ?
or will it come about by negotiated and fair solutions , ensuring majority rule , minority rights , and economic advance ?
america is committed to the side of peace and justice and to the principle that africa should shape its own future , free of outside intervention .
american leadership has helped to stimulate new international efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to shape a comprehensive treaty governing the use of oceans .
i am gratified by these accomplishments .
they constitute a record of broad success for america and for the peace and prosperity of all mankind .
this administration leaves to its successor a world in better condition than we found .
we leave , as well , a solid foundation for progress on a range of issues that are vital to the well - being of america .
what has been achieved in the field of foreign affairs and what can be accomplished by the new administration demonstrate the genius of americans working together for the common good .
it is this , our remarkable ability to work together , that has made us a unique nation .
it is congress , the president , and the people striving for a better world .
i know all patriotic americans want this nation 's foreign policy to succeed .
i urge members of my party in this congress to give the new president loyal support in this area .
i express the hope that this new congress will reexamine its constitutional role in international affairs .
the exclusive right to declare war , the duty to advise and consent on the part of the senate , the power of the purse on the part of the house are ample authority for the legislative branch and should be jealously guarded .
but because we may have been too careless of these powers in the past does not justify congressional intrusion into , or obstruction of , the proper exercise of presidential responsibilities now or in the future .
there can be only one commander in chief .
in these times crises can not be managed and wars can not be waged by committee , nor can peace be pursued solely by parliamentary debate .
to the ears of the world , the president speaks for the nation .
while he is , of course , ultimately accountable to the congress , the courts , and the people , he and his emissaries must not be handicapped in advance in their relations with foreign governments as has sometimes happened in the past .
at home i am encouraged by the nation 's recovery from the recession and our steady return to sound economic growth .
it is now continuing after the recent period of uncertainty , which is part of the price we pay for free elections .
our most pressing need today and the future is more jobs -- productive , permanent jobs created by a thriving economy .
we must revise our tax system both to ease the burden of heavy taxation and to encourage the investment necessary for the creation of productive jobs for all americans who want to work .
earlier this month i proposed a permanent income tax reduction of $ 10 billion below current levels , including raising the personal exemption from $ 750 to $ 1,000 .
i also recommended a series of measures to stimulate investment , such as accelerated depreciation for new plants and equipment in areas of high unemployment , a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 48 to 46 percent , and eliminating the present double taxation of dividends .
i strongly urge the congress to pass these measures to help create the productive , permanent jobs in the private economy that are so essential for our future .
all the basic trends are good ; we are not on the brink of another recession or economic disaster .
if we follow prudent policies that encourage productive investment and discourage destructive inflation , we will come out on top , and i am sure we will .
we have successfully cut inflation by more than half .
when i took office , the consumer price index was rising at 12.2 percent a year .
during 1976 the rate of inflation was 5 percent .
we have created more jobs -- over four million more jobs today than in the spring of 1975 .
throughout this nation today we have over 88 million people in useful , productive jobs -- more than at any other time in our nation 's history .
but there are still too many americans unemployed .
this is the greatest regret that i have as i leave office .
we brought about with the congress , after much delay , the renewal of the general revenue sharing .
we expanded community development and federal manpower programs .
we began a significant urban mass transit program .
federal programs today provide more funds for our states and local governments than ever before -- $ 70 billion for the current fiscal year .
through these programs and others that provide aid directly to individuals , we have kept faith with our tradition of compassionate help for those who need it .
as we begin our third century we can be proud of the progress that we have made in meeting human needs for all of our citizens .
we have cut the growth of crime by nearly 90 percent .
two years ago crime was increasing at the rate of 18 percent annually .
in the first three quarters of 1976 , that growth rate had been cut to 2 percent .
but crime , and the fear of crime , remains one of the most serious problems facing our citizens .
we have had some successes , and there have been some disappointments .
bluntly , i must remind you that we have not made satisfactory progress toward achieving energy independence .
energy is absolutely vital to the defense of our country , to the strength of our economy , and to the quality of our lives .
two years ago i proposed to the congress the first comprehensive national energy program -- a specific and coordinated set of measures that would end our vulnerability to embargo , blockade , or arbitrary price increases and would mobilize u. s. technology and resources to supply a significant share of the free world 's energy after 1985 .
of the major energy proposals i submitted two years ago , only half , belatedly , became law .
in 1973 we were dependent upon foreign oil imports for 36 percent of our needs .
today , we are 40 percent dependent , and we 'll pay out $ 34 billion for foreign oil this year .
such vulnerability at present or in the future is intolerable and must be ended .
the answer to where we stand on our national energy effort today reminds me of the old argument about whether the tank is half full or half empty .
the pessimist will say we have half failed to achieve our 10-year energy goals ; the optimist will say that we have half succeeded .
i am always an optimist , but we must make up for lost time .
we have laid a solid foundation for completing the enormous task which confronts us .
i have signed into law five major energy bills which contain significant measures for conservation , resource development , stockpiling , and standby authorities .
we have moved forward to develop the naval petroleum reserves ; to build a 500-million barrel strategic petroleum stockpile ; to phase out unnecessary government allocation and price controls ; to develop a lasting relationship with other oil consuming nations ; to improve the efficiency of energy use through conservation in automobiles , buildings , and industry ; and to expand research on new technology and renewable resources such as wind power , geothermal and solar energy .
all these actions , significant as they are for the long term , are only the beginning .
i recently submitted to the congress my proposals to reorganize the federal energy structure and the hard choices which remain if we are serious about reducing our dependence upon foreign energy .
these include programs to reverse our declining production of natural gas and increase incentives for domestic crude oil production .
i proposed to minimize environmental uncertainties affecting coal development , expand nuclear power generation , and create an energy independence authority to provide government financial assistance for vital energy programs where private capital is not available .
we must explore every reasonable prospect for meeting our energy needs when our current domestic reserves of oil and natural gas begin to dwindle in the next decade .
i urgently ask congress and the new administration to move quickly on these issues .
this nation has the resources and the capability to achieve our energy goals if its government has the will to proceed , and i think we do .
i have been disappointed by inability to complete many of the meaningful organizational reforms which i contemplated for the federal government , although a start has been made .
for example , the federal judicial system has long served as a modal for other courts .
but today it is threatened by a shortage of qualified federal judges and an explosion of litigation claiming federal jurisdiction .
i commend to the new administration and the congress the recent report and recommendations of the department of justice , undertaken at my request , on " the needs of the federal courts . "
i especially endorse its proposals for a new commission on the judicial appointment process .
while the judicial branch of our government may require reinforcement , the budgets and payrolls of the other branches remain staggering .
i can not help but observe that while the white house staff and the executive office of the president have been reduced and the total number of civilians in the executive branch contained during the 1970s , the legislative branch has increased substantially although the membership of the congress remains at 535 .
congress now costs the taxpayers more than a million dollars per member ; the whole legislative budget has passed the billion dollar mark . [
set out to reduce the growth in the size and spending of the federal government , but no president can accomplish this alone .
the congress sidetracked most of my requests for authority to consolidate overlapping programs and agencies , to return more decisionmaking and responsibility to state and local governments through block grants instead of rigid categorical programs , and to eliminate unnecessary red tape and outrageously complex regulations .
we have made some progress in cutting back the expansion of government and its intrusion into individual lives , but believe me , there is much more to be done -- and you and i know it .
it can only be done by tough and temporarily painful surgery by a congress as prepared as the president to face up to this very real political problem .
again , i wish my successor , working with a substantial majority of his own party , the best of success in reforming the costly and cumbersome machinery of the federal government .
the task of self - government is never finished .
the problems are great ; the opportunities are greater .
america 's first goal is and always will be peace with honor .
america must remain first in keeping peace in the world .
we can remain first in peace only if we are never second in defense .
in presenting the state of the union to the congress and to the american people , i have a special obligation as commander in chief to report on our national defense .
our survival as a free and independent people requires , above all , strong military forces that are well equipped and highly trained to perform their assigned mission .
i am particularly gratified to report that over the past two years , we have been able to reverse the dangerous decline of the previous decade in real resources this country was devoting to national defense .
this was an immediate problem i faced in 1974 .
the evidence was unmistakable that the soviet union had been steadily increasing the resources it applied to building its military strength .
during this same period the united states real defense spending declined .
in my three budgets we not only arrested that dangerous decline , but we have established the positive trend which is essential to our ability to contribute to peace and stability in the world .
the vietnam war , both materially and psychologically , affected our overall defense posture .
the dangerous anti - military sentiment discouraged defense spending and unfairly disparaged the men and women who serve in our armed forces .
the challenge that now confronts this country is whether we have the national will and determination to continue this essential defense effort over the long term , as it must be continued .
we can no longer afford to oscillate from year to year in so vital a matter ; indeed , we have a duty to look beyond the immediate question of budgets and to examine the nature of the problem we will face over the next generation .
i am the first recent president able to address long - term , basic issues without the burden of vietnam .
the war in indochina consumed enormous resources at the very time that the overwhelming strategic superiority we once enjoyed was disappearing .
in past years , as a result of decisions by the united states , our strategic forces leveled off , yet the soviet union continued a steady , constant buildup of its own forces , committing a high percentage of its national economic effort to defense .
the united states can never tolerate a shift in strategic balance against us or even a situation where the american people or our allies believe the balance is shifting against us .
the united states would risk the most serious political consequences if the world came to believe that our adversaries have a decisive margin of superiority .
to maintain a strategic balance we must look ahead to the 1980s and beyond .
the sophistication of modern weapons requires that we make decisions now if we are to ensure our security 10 years from now .
therefore , i have consistently advocated and strongly urged that we pursue three critical strategic programs : the trident missile launching submarine ; the b-1 bomber , with its superior capability to penetrate modern air defenses ; and a more advanced intercontinental ballistic missile that will be better able to survive nuclear attack and deliver a devastating retaliatory strike .
in an era where the strategic nuclear forces are in rough equilibrium , the risks of conflict below the nuclear threshold may grow more perilous .
a major , long - term objective , therefore , is to maintain capabilities to deal with , and thereby deter , conventional challenges and crises , particularly in europe .
we can not rely solely on strategic forces to guarantee our security or to deter all types of aggression .
we must have superior naval and marine forces to maintain freedom of the seas , strong multipurpose tactical air forces , and mobile , modern ground forces .
accordingly , i have directed a long - term effort to improve our worldwide capabilities to deal with regional crises .
i have submitted a five - year naval building program indispensable to the nation 's maritime strategy .
because the security of europe and the integrity of nato remain the cornerstone of american defense policy , i have initiated a special , long - term program to ensure the capacity of the alliance to deter or defeat aggression in europe .
as i leave office i can report that our national defense is effectively deterring conflict today .
our armed forces are capable of carrying out the variety of missions assigned to them .
programs are underway which will assure we can deter war in the years ahead .
but i also must warn that it will require a sustained effort over a period of years to maintain these capabilities .
we must have the wisdom , the stamina , and the courage to prepare today for the perils of tomorrow , and i believe we will .
as i look to the future -- and i assure you i intend to go on doing that for a good many years -- i can say with confidence that the state of the union is good , but we must go on making it better and better .
this gathering symbolizes the constitutional foundation which makes continued progress possible , synchronizing the skills of three independent branches of government , reserving fundamental sovereignty to the people of this great land .
it is only as the temporary representatives and servants of the people that we meet here , we bring no hereditary status or gift of infallibility , and none follows us from this place .
like president washington , like the more fortunate of his successors , i look forward to the status of private citizen with gladness and gratitude .
to me , being a citizen of the united states of america is the greatest honor and privilege in this world .
from the opportunities which fate and my fellow citizens have given me , as a member of the house , as vice president and president of the senate , and as president of all the people , i have come to understand and place the highest value on the checks and balances which our founders imposed on government through the separation of powers among co - equal legislative , executive , and judicial branches .
this often results in difficulty and delay , as i well know , but it also places supreme authority under god , beyond any one person , any one branch , any majority great or small , or any one party .
the constitution is the bedrock of all our freedoms .
guard and cherish it , keep honor and order in your own house , and the republic will endure .
it is not easy to end these remarks .
in this chamber , along with some of you , i have experienced many , many of the highlights of my life .
it was here that i stood 28 years ago with my freshman colleagues , as speaker sam rayburn administered the oath .
i see some of you now -- charlie bennett , dick bolling , carl perkins , pete rodino , harley staggers , tom steed , sid yates , clem zablocki -- and i remember those who have gone to their rest .
it was here we waged many , many a lively battle -- won some , lost some , but always remaining friends .
it was here , surrounded by such friends , that the distinguished chief justice swore me in as vice president on december 6 , 1973 .
it was here i returned eight months later as your president to ask not for a honeymoon , but for a good marriage .
i will always treasure those memories and your many , many kindnesses .
i thank you for them all .
my fellow americans , i once asked you for your prayers , and now i give you mine : may god guide this wonderful country , its people , and those they have chosen to lead them .
may our third century be illuminated by liberty and blessed with brotherhood , so that we and all who come after us may be the humble servants of thy peace .
amen .
good night .
god bless you .

mr. chairman , delegates and alternates to this republican convention : 
 i am honored by your nomination , and i accept it with pride , with gratitude , and with a total will to win a great victory for the american people .
we will wage a winning campaign in every region of this country , from the snowy banks of minnesota to the sandy plains of georgia .
we concede not a single state .
we concede not a single vote .
this evening i am proud to stand before this great convention as the first incumbent president since dwight d. eisenhower who can tell the american people america is at peace .
tonight i can tell you straightaway this nation is sound , this nation is secure , this nation is on the march to full economic recovery and a better quality of life for all americans .
and i will tell you one more thing : this year the issues are on our side .
i am ready , i am eager to go before the american people and debate the real issues face to face with jimmy carter .
the american people have a right to know firsthand exactly where both of us stand .
i am deeply grateful to those who stood with me in winning the nomination of the party whose cause i have served all of my adult life .
i respect the convictions of those who want a change in washington .
i want a change , too .
after 22 long years of majority misrule , let 's change the united states congress .
my gratitude tonight reaches far beyond this arena to countless friends whose confidence , hard work , and unselfish support have brought me to this moment .
it would be unfair to single out anyone , but may i make an exception for my wonderful family -- mike , jack , steve , and susan and especially my dear wife , betty .
we republicans have had some tough competition .
we not only preach the virtues of competition , we practice them .
but tonight we come together not on a battlefield to conclude a cease - fire , but to join forces on a training field that has conditioned us all for the rugged contest ahead .
let me say this from the bottom of my heart : after the scrimmages of the past few months , it really feels good to have ron reagan on the same side of the line .
to strengthen our championship lineup , the convention has wisely chosen one of the ablest americans as our next vice president , senator bob dole of kansas .
with his help , with your help , with the help of millions of americans who cherish peace , who want freedom preserved , prosperity shared , and pride in america , we will win this election .
i speak not of a republican victory , but a victory for the american people .
you at home listening tonight , you are the people who pay the taxes and obey the laws .
you are the people who make our system work .
you are the people who make america what it is .
it is from your ranks that i come and on your side that i stand .
something wonderful happened to this country of ours the past two years .
we all came to realize it on the fourth of july .
together , out of years of turmoil and tragedy , wars and riots , assassinations and wrongdoing in high places , americans recaptured the spirit of 1776 .
we saw again the pioneer vision of our revolutionary founders and our immigrant ancestors .
their vision was of free men and free women enjoying limited government and unlimited opportunity .
the mandate i want in 1976 is to make this vision a reality , but it will take the voices and the votes of many more americans who are not republicans to make that mandate binding and my mission possible .
i have been called an unelected president , an accidental president .
we may even hear that again from the other party , despite the fact that i was welcomed and endorsed by an overwhelming majority of their elected representatives in the congress who certified my fitness to our highest office .
having become vice president and president without expecting or seeking either , i have a special feeling toward these high offices .
to me , the presidency and the vice - presidency were not prizes to be won , but a duty to be done .
so , tonight it is not the power and the glamour of the presidency that leads me to ask for another four years ; it is something every hard - working american will understand -- the challenge of a job well begun , but far from finished .
two years ago , on august 9 , 1974 , i placed my hand on the bible , which betty held , and took the same constitutional oath that was administered to george washington .
i had faith in our people , in our institutions , and in myself . "
my fellow americans , " i said , " our long national nightmare is over . "
it was an hour in our history that troubled our minds and tore at our hearts .
anger and hatred had risen to dangerous levels , dividing friends and families .
the polarization of our political order had aroused unworthy passions of reprisal and revenge .
our governmental system was closer to stalemate than at any time since abraham lincoln took the same oath of office .
our economy was in the throes of runaway inflation , taking us headlong into the worst recession since franklin d. roosevelt took the same oath .
on that dark day i told my fellow countrymen , " i am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots , so i ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers . "
on a marble fireplace in the white house is carved a prayer which john adams wrote .
it concludes , " may none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof . "
since i have resided in that historic house , i have tried to live by that prayer .
i faced many tough problems .
i probably made some mistakes , but on balance , america and americans have made an incredible comeback since august 1974 .
nobody can honestly say otherwise .
and the plain truth is that the great progress we have made at home and abroad was in spite of the majority who run the congress of the united states .
for two years i have stood for all the people against a vote - hungry , free - spending congressional majority on capitol hill .
fifty - five times i vetoed extravagant and unwise legislation ; 45 times i made those vetoes stick .
those vetoes have saved american taxpayers billions and billions of dollars .
i am against the big tax spender and for the little taxpayer .
i called for a permanent tax cut , coupled with spending reductions , to stimulate the economy and relieve hard - pressed , middle - income taxpayers .
your personal exemption must be raised from $ 750 to $ 1,000 .
the other party 's platform talks about tax reform , but there is one big problem -- their own congress wo n't act .
i called for reasonable constitutional restrictions on court - ordered busing of schoolchildren , but the other party 's platform concedes that busing should be a last resort .
but there is the same problem -- their own congress wo n't act .
i called for a major overhaul of criminal laws to crack down on crime and illegal drugs .
the other party 's platform deplores america 's $ 90 billion cost of crime .
there is the problem again -- their own congress wo n't act .
the other party 's platform talks about a strong defense .
now , here is the other side of the problem -- their own congress did act .
they slashed $ 50 billion from our national defense needs in the last 10 years .
my friends , washington is not the problem ; their congress is the problem .
you know , the president of the united states is not a magician who can wave a wand or sign a paper that will instantly end a war , cure a recession , or make bureaucracy disappear .
a president has immense powers under the constitution , but all of them ultimately come from the american people and their mandate to him .
that is why , tonight , i turn to the american people and ask not only for your prayers but also for your strength and your support , for your voice , and for your vote .
i come before you with a 2-year record of performance without your mandate .
i offer you a 4-year pledge of greater performance with your mandate .
as governor al smith used to say , " let 's look at the record . "
two years ago inflation was 12 percent .
sales were off .
plants were shut down .
thousands were being laid off every week .
fear of the future was throttling down our economy and threatening millions of families .
let 's look at the record since august 1974 .
inflation has been cut in half .
payrolls are up .
profits are up .
production is up .
purchases are up .
since the recession was turned around , almost 4 million of our fellow americans have found new jobs or got their old jobs back .
this year more men and women have jobs than ever before in the history of the united states .
confidence has returned , and we are in the full surge of sound recovery to steady prosperity .
two years ago america was mired in withdrawal from southeast asia .
a decade of congresses had shortchanged our global defenses and threatened our strategic posture .
mounting tension between israel and the arab nations made another war seem inevitable .
the whole world watched and wondered where america was going .
did we in our domestic turmoil have the will , the stamina , and the unity to stand up for freedom ?
look at the record since august , two years ago .
today america is at peace and seeks peace for all nations .
not a single american is at war anywhere on the face of this earth tonight .
our ties with western europe and japan , economic as well as military , were never stronger .
our relations with eastern europe , the soviet union , and mainland china are firm , vigilant , and forward looking .
policies i have initiated offer sound progress for the peoples of the pacific , africa , and latin america .
israel and egypt , both trusting the united states , have taken an historic step that promises an eventual just settlement for the whole middle east .
the world now respects america 's policy of peace through strength .
the united states is again the confident leader of the free world .
nobody questions our dedication to peace , but nobody doubts our willingness to use our strength when our vital interests are at stake , and we will .
i called for an up - to - date , powerful army , navy , air force , and marines that will keep america secure for decades .
a strong military posture is always the best insurance for peace .
but america 's strength has never rested on arms alone .
it is rooted in our mutual commitment of our citizens and leaders in the highest standards of ethics and morality and in the spiritual renewal which our nation is undergoing right now .
two years ago people 's confidence in their highest officials , to whom they had overwhelmingly entrusted power , had twice been shattered .
losing faith in the word of their elected leaders , americans lost some of their own faith in themselves .
again , let 's look at the record since august 1974 .
from the start my administration has been open , candid , forthright .
while my entire public and private life was under searching examination for the vice - presidency , i reaffirmed my lifelong conviction that truth is the glue that holds government together -- not only government but civilization itself .
i have demanded honesty , decency , and personal integrity from everybody in the executive branch of the government .
the house and senate have the same duty .
the american people will not accept a double standard in the united states congress .
those who make our laws today must not debase the reputation of our great legislative bodies that have given us such giants as daniel webster , henry clay , sam rayburn , and robert a. taft .
whether in the nation 's capital , the state capital , or city hall , private morality and public trust must go together .
from august of 1974 to august of 1976 , the record shows steady progress upward toward prosperity , peace , and public trust .
my record is one of progress , not platitudes .
my record is one of specifics , not smiles .
my record is one of performance , not promises .
it is a record i am proud to run on .
it is a record the american people -- democrats , independents , and republicans alike -- will support on november 2 .
for the next four years i pledge to you that i will hold to the steady course we have begun .
but i have no intention of standing on the record alone .
we will continue winning the fight against inflation .
we will go on reducing the dead weight and impudence of bureaucracy .
we will submit a balanced budget by 1978 .
we will improve the quality of life at work , at play , and in our homes and in our neighborhoods .
we will not abandon our cities .
we will encourage urban programs which assure safety in the streets , create healthy environments , and restore neighborhood pride .
we will return control of our children 's education to parents and local school authorities .
we will make sure that the party of lincoln remains the party of equal rights .
we will create a tax structure that is fair for all our citizens , one that preserves the continuity of the family home , the family farm , and the family business .
we will ensure the integrity of the social security system and improve medicare so that our older citizens can enjoy the health and the happiness that they have earned .
there is no reason they should have to go broke just to get well .
we will make sure that this rich nation does not neglect citizens who are less fortunate , but provides for their needs with compassion and with dignity .
we will reduce the growth and the cost of government and allow individual breadwinners and businesses to keep more of the money that they earn .
we will create a climate in which our economy will provide a meaningful job for everyone who wants to work and a decent standard of life for all americans .
we will ensure that all of our young people have a better chance in life than we had , an education they can use , and a career they can be proud of .
we will carry out a farm policy that assures a fair market price for the farmer , encourages full production , leads to record exports , and eases the hunger within the human family .
we will never use the bounty of america 's farmers as a pawn in international diplomacy .
there will be no embargoes .
we will continue our strong leadership to bring peace , justice , and economic progress where there is turmoil , especially in the middle east .
we will build a safer and saner world through patient negotiations and dependable arms agreements which reduce the danger of conflict and horror of thermonuclear war .
while i am president , we will not return to a collision course that could reduce civilization to ashes .
we will build an america where people feel rich in spirit as well as in worldly goods .
we will build an america where people feel proud about themselves and about their country .
we will build on performance , not promises ; experience , not expediency ; real progress instead of mysterious plans to be revealed in some dim and distant future .
the american people are wise , wiser than our opponents think .
they know who pays for every campaign promise .
they are not afraid of the truth .
we will tell them the truth .
from start to finish , our campaign will be credible ; it will be responsible .
we will come out fighting , and we will win .
yes , we have all seen the polls and the pundits who say our party is dead .
i have heard that before .
so did harry truman .
i will tell you what i think .
the only polls that count are the polls the american people go to on november 2 .
and right now , i predict that the american people are going to say that night , " jerry , you have done a good job , keep right on doing it . "
as i try in my imagination to look into the homes where families are watching the end of this great convention , i ca n't tell which faces are republicans , which are democrats , and which are independents .
i can not see their color or their creed .
i see only americans .
i see americans who love their husbands , their wives , and their children .
i see americans who love their country for what it has been and what it must become .
i see americans who work hard , but who are willing to sacrifice all they have worked for to keep their children and their country free .
i see americans who in their own quiet way pray for peace among nations and peace among themselves .
we do love our neighbors , and we do forgive those who have trespassed against us .
i see a new generation that knows what is right and knows itself , a generation determined to preserve its ideals , its environment , our nation , and the world .
my fellow americans , i like what i see .
i have no fear for the future of this great country .
and as we go forward together , i promise you once more what i promised before : to uphold the constitution , to do what is right as god gives ?
me to see the right , and to do the very best that i can for america .
god helping me , i wo n't let you down .
thank you very much .

mr. speaker , mr. vice president , members of the 94th congress , and distinguished guests : twenty - six years ago , a freshman congressman , a young fellow with lots of idealism who was out to change the world , stood before sam rayburn in the well of the house and solemnly swore to the same oath that all of you took yesterday -- an unforgettable experience , and i congratulate you all .
two days later , that same freshman stood at the back of this great chamber -- over there someplace -- as president truman , all charged up by his single - handed election victory , reported as the constitution requires on the state of the union .
when the bipartisan applause stopped , president truman said , " i am happy to report to this 81st congress that the state of the union is good .
our nation is better able than ever before to meet the needs of the american people , and to give them their fair chance in the pursuit of happiness .
is foremost among the nations of the world in the search for peace."today , that freshman member from michigan stands where mr. truman stood , and i must say to you that the state of the union is not good : millions of americans are out of work .
recession and inflation are eroding the money of millions more .
prices are too high , and sales are too slow .
this year 's federal deficit will be about $ 30 billion ; next year 's probably $ 45 billion .
the national debt will rise to over $ 500 billion .
our plant capacity and productivity are not increasing fast enough .
we depend on others for essential energy .
some people question their government 's ability to make hard decisions and stick with them ; they expect washington politics as usual .
yet , what president truman said on january 5 , 1949 , is even more true in 1975 .
we are better able to meet our people 's needs .
all americans do have a fairer chance to pursue happiness .
not only are we still the foremost nation in the pursuit of peace but today 's prospects of attaining it are infinitely brighter .
there were 59 million americans employed at the start of 1949 ; now there are more than 85 million americans who have jobs .
in comparable dollars , the average income of the american family has doubled during the past 26 years .
now , i want to speak very bluntly .
i 've got bad news , and i do n't expect much , if any , applause .
the american people want action , and it will take both the congress and the president to give them what they want .
progress and solutions can be achieved , and they will be achieved .
my message today is not intended to address all of the complex needs of america .
i will send separate messages making specific recommendations for domestic legislation , such as the extension of general revenue sharing and the voting rights act .
the moment has come to move in a new direction .
we can do this by fashioning a new partnership between the congress on the one hand , the white house on the other , and the people we both represent .
let us mobilize the most powerful and most creative industrial nation that ever existed on this earth to put all our people to work .
the emphasis on our economic efforts must now shift from inflation to jobs .
to bolster business and industry and to create new jobs , i propose a one - year tax reduction of $ 16 billion .
three - quarters would go to individuals and one - quarter to promote business investment .
this cash rebate to individuals amounts to 12 percent of 1974 tax payments -- a total cut of $ 12 billion , with a maximum of $ 1,000 per return .
i call on the congress to act by april 1 .
if you do -- and i hope you will -- the treasury can send the first check for half of the rebate in may and the second by september .
the other one - fourth of the cut , about $ 4 billion , will go to business , including farms , to promote expansion and to create more jobs .
the one - year reduction for businesses would be in the form of a liberalized investment tax credit increasing the rate to 12 percent for all businesses .
this tax cut does not include the more fundamental reforms needed in our tax system .
but it points us in the right direction -- allowing taxpayers rather than the government to spend their pay .
cutting taxes now is essential if we are to turn the economy around .
a tax cut offers the best hope of creating more jobs .
unfortunately , it will increase the size of the budget deficit .
therefore , it is more important than ever that we take steps to control the growth of federal expenditures .
part of our trouble is that we have been self - indulgent .
for decades , we have been voting ever - increasing levels of government benefits , and now the bill has come due .
we have been adding so many new programs that the size and the growth of the federal budget has taken on a life of its own .
one characteristic of these programs is that their cost increases automatically every year because the number of people eligible for most of the benefits increases every year .
when these programs are enacted , there is no dollar amount set .
no one knows what they will cost .
all we know is that whatever they cost last year , they will cost more next year .
it is a question of simple arithmetic .
unless we check the excessive growth of federal expenditures or impose on ourselves matching increases in taxes , we will continue to run huge inflationary deficits in the federal budget .
if we project the current built - in momentum of federal spending through the next 15 years , state , federal , and local government expenditures could easily comprise half of our gross national product .
this compares with less than a third in 1975.i have just concluded the process of preparing the budget submissions for fiscal year 1976 .
in that budget , i will propose legislation to restrain the growth of a number of existing programs .
i have also concluded that no new spending programs can be initiated this year , except for energy .
further , i will not hesitate to veto any new spending programs adopted by the congress .
as an additional step toward putting the federal government 's house in order , i recommend a 5-percent limit on federal pay increases in 1975 .
in all government programs tied to the consumer price index -- including social security , civil service and military retirement pay , and food stamps -- i also propose a one - year maximum increase of 5 percent .
none of these recommended ceiling limitations , over which congress has final authority , are easy to propose , because in most cases they involve anticipated payments to many , many deserving people .
nonetheless , it must be done .
i must emphasize that i am not asking to eliminate , to reduce , to freeze these payments .
i am merely recommending that we slow down the rate at which these payments increase and these programs grow .
only a reduction in the growth of spending can keep federal borrowing down and reduce the damage to the private sector from high interest rates .
only a reduction in spending can make it possible for the federal reserve system to avoid an inflationary growth in the money supply and thus restore balance to our economy .
a major reduction in the growth of federal spending can help dispel the uncertainty that so many feel about our economy and put us on the way to curing our economic ills .
if we do n't act to slow down the rate of increase in federal spending , the united states treasury will be legally obligated to spend more than $ 360 billion in fiscal year 1976 , even if no new programs are enacted .
these are not matters of conjecture or prediction , but again , a matter of simple arithmetic .
the size of these numbers and their implications for our everyday life and the health of our economic system are shocking .
i submitted to the last congress a list of budget deferrals and rescissions .
there will be more cuts recommended in the budget that i will submit .
even so , the level of outlays for fiscal year 1976 is still much , much too high .
not only is it too high for this year but the decisions we make now will inevitably have a major and growing impact on expenditure levels in future years .
i think this is a very fundamental issue that we , the congress and i , must jointly solve .
economic disruptions we and others are experiencing stem in part from the fact that the world price of petroleum has quadrupled in the last year .
but in all honesty , we can not put all of the blame on the oil - exporting nations .
we , the united states , are not blameless .
our growing dependence upon foreign sources has been adding to our vulnerability for years and years , and we did nothing to prepare ourselves for such an event as the embargo of 1973.during the 1960s , this country had a surplus capacity of crude oil which we were able to make available to our trading partners whenever there was a disruption of supply .
this surplus capacity enabled us to influence both supplies and prices of crude oil throughout the world .
our excess capacity neutralized any effort at establishing an effective cartel , and thus the rest of the world was assured of adequate supplies of oil at reasonable prices .
by 1970 , our surplus capacity had vanished , and as a consequence , the latent power of the oil cartel could emerge in full force .
europe and japan , both heavily dependent on imported oil , now struggle to keep their economies in balance .
even the united states , our country , which is far more self - sufficient than most other industrial countries , has been .put under serious pressure .
i am proposing a program which will begin to restore our country 's surplus capacity in total energy .
in this way , we will be able to assure ourselves reliable and adequate energy and help foster a new world energy stability for other major consuming nations .
but this nation and , in fact , the world must face the prospect of energy difficulties between now and 1985 .
this program will impose burdens on all of us with the aim of reducing our consumption of energy and increasing our production .
great attention has been paid to the considerations of fairness , and i can assure you that the burdens will not fall more harshly on those less able to bear them .
i am recommending a plan to make us invulnerable to cutoffs of foreign oil .
it will require sacrifices , but it -- and this is most important -- it will work .
i have set the following national energy goals to assure that our future is as secure and as productive as our past : first , we must reduce oil imports by one million barrels per day by the end of this year and by two million barrels per day by the end of 1977.second , we must end vulnerability to economic disruption by foreign suppliers by 1985.third , we must develop our energy technology and resources so that the united states has the ability to supply a significant share of the energy needs of the free world by the end of this century .
to attain these objectives , we need immediate action to cut imports .
unfortunately , in the short term there are only a limited number of actions which can increase domestic supply .
i will press for all of them .
i urge quick action on the necessary legislation to allow commercial production at the elk hills , california , naval petroleum reserve .
in order that we make greater use of domestic coal resources , i am submitting amendments to the energy supply and environmental coordination act which will greatly increase the number of powerplants that can be promptly converted to coal .
obviously , voluntary conservation continues to be essential , but tougher programs are needed -- and needed now .
therefore , i am using presidential powers to raise the fee on all imported crude oil and petroleum products .
the crude oil fee level will be increased $ 1 per barrel on february 1 , by $ 2 per barrel on march 1 , and by $ 3 per barrel on april 1 .
i will take actions to reduce undue hardships on any geographical region .
the foregoing are interim administrative actions .
they will be rescinded when the broader but necessary legislation is enacted .
to that end , i am requesting the congress to act within 90 days on a more comprehensive energy tax program .
it includes : excise taxes and import fees totaling $ 2 per barrel on product imports and on all crude oil ; deregulation of new natural gas and enactment of a natural gas excise tax .
i plan to take presidential initiative to decontrol the price of domestic crude oil on april 1 .
i urge the congress to enact a windfall profits tax by that date to ensure that oil producers do not profit unduly .
the sooner congress acts , the more effective the oil conservation program will be and the quicker the federal revenues can be returned to our people .
i am prepared to use presidential authority to limit imports , as necessary , to guarantee success .
i want you to know that before deciding on my energy conservation program , i considered rationing and higher gasoline taxes as alternatives .
in my judgment , neither would achieve the desired results and both would produce unacceptable inequities .
a massive program must be initiated to increase energy supply , to cut demand , and provide new standby emergency programs to achieve the independence we want by 1985 .
the largest part of increased oil production must come from new frontier areas on the outer continental shelf and from the naval petroleum reserve no .
4 in alaska .
it is the intent of this administration to move ahead with exploration , leasing , and production on those frontier areas of the outer continental shelf where the environmental risks are acceptable .
use of our most abundant domestic resource -- coal -- is severely limited .
we must strike a reasonable compromise on environmental concerns with coal .
i am submitting clean air   amendments which will allow greater coal use without sacrificing clean air goals .
i vetoed the strip mining legislation passed by the last congress .
with appropriate changes , i will sign a revised version when it comes to the white house .
i am proposing a number of actions to energize our nuclear power program .
i will submit legislation to expedite nuclear leasing   and the rapid selection of sites .
in recent months , utilities have cancelled or postponed over 60 percent of planned nuclear expansion and 30 percent of planned additions to non - nuclear capacity .
financing problems for that industry are worsening .
i am therefore recommending that the one - year investment tax credit of 12 percent be extended an additional two years to specifically speed the construction of powerplants that do not use natural gas or oil .
i am also submitting proposals for selective reform of state utility commission regulations .
to provide the critical stability for our domestic energy production in the face of world price uncertainty , i will request legislation to authorize and require tariffs , import quotas , or price floors to protect our energy prices at levels which will achieve energy independence .
increasing energy supplies is not enough .
we must take additional steps to cut long - term consumption .
i therefore propose to the congress : legislation to make thermal efficiency standards mandatory for all new buildings in the united states ; a new tax credit of up to $ 150 for those homeowners who install insulation equipment ; the establishment of an energy conservation program to help low - income families purchase insulation supplies ; legislation to modify and defer automotive pollution standards for five years , which will enable us to improve automobile gas mileage by 40 percent by 1980.these proposals and actions , cumulatively , can reduce our dependence on foreign energy supplies from three to five million barrels per day by 1985 .
to make the united states invulnerable to foreign disruption , i propose standby emergency legislation and a strategic storage program of one billion barrels of oil for domestic needs and 300 million barrels for national defense purposes .
i will ask for the funds needed for energy research and development activities .
i have established a goal of one million barrels of synthetic fuels and shale oil production per day by 1985 together with an incentive program to achieve it .
i have a very deep belief in america 's capabilities .
within the next 10 years , my program envisions : 200 major nuclear powerplants ; 250 major new coal mines ; 150 major coal - fired powerplants ; 30 major new   refineries ; 20 major new synthetic fuel plants ; the drilling of many thousands of new oil wells ; the insulation of 18 million homes ; and the manufacturing and the sale of millions of new automobiles , trucks , and buses that use much less fuel .
i happen to believe that we can do it .
in another crisis -- the one in 1942 president franklin d. roosevelt said this country would build 60,000   military aircraft .
by 1943 , production in that program had reached 125,000 aircraft annually .
they did it then .
we can do it now .
if the congress and the american people will work with me to attain these targets , they will be achieved and will be surpassed .
from adversity , let us seize opportunity .
revenues of some $ 30 billion from higher energy taxes designed to encourage conservation must be refunded to the american people in a manner which corrects distortions in our tax system wrought by inflation .
people have been pushed into higher tax brackets by inflation , with consequent reduction in their actual spending power .
business taxes are similarly distorted because inflation exaggerates reported profits , resulting in excessive taxes .
accordingly , i propose that future individual income taxes be reduced by $ 16.5 billion .
this will be done by raising the low - income allowance and reducing tax rates .
this continuing tax cut will primarily benefit lower- and middle - income taxpayers .
for example , a typical family of four with a gross income of $ 5,600 now pays $ 185 in federal income taxes .
under this tax cut plan , they would pay nothing .
a family of four with a gross income of $ 12,500 now pays $ 1,260 in federal taxes .
my proposal reduces that total by $ 300 .
families grossing $ 20,000 would receive a reduction of $ 210.those with the very lowest incomes , who can least afford higher costs , must also be compensated .
i propose a payment of $ 80 to every person 18 years of age and older in that very limited category .
state and local governments will receive $ 2 billion in additional revenue sharing to offset their increased energy costs .
to offset inflationary distortions and to generate more economic activity , the corporate tax rate will be reduced from 48 percent to 42 percent .
now let me turn , if i might , to the international dimension of the present crisis .
at no time in our peacetime history has the state of the nation depended more heavily on the state of the world .
and seldom , if ever , has the state of the world depended more heavily on the state of our nation .
the economic distress is global .
we will not solve it at home unless we help to remedy the profound economic dislocation abroad .
world trade and monetary structure provides markets , energy , food , and vital raw materials -- for all nations .
this international system is now in jeopardy .
this nation can be proud of significant achievements in recent years in solving problems and crises .
the berlin agreement , the salt agreements , our new relationship with china , the unprecedented efforts in the middle east are immensely encouraging .
but the world is not free from crisis .
in a world of 150 nations , where nuclear technology is proliferating and regional conflicts continue , international security can not be taken for granted .
so , let there be no mistake about it : international cooperation is a vital factor of our lives today .
this is not a moment for the american people to turn inward .
more than ever before , our own well - being depends on america 's determination and america 's leadership in the whole wide world .
we are a great nation -- spiritually , politically , militarily , diplomatically , and economically .
america 's commitment to international security has sustained the safety of allies and friends in many areas -- in the middle east , in europe , and in asia .
our turning away would unleash new instabilities , new dangers around the globe , which , in turn , would threaten our own security .
at the end of world war ii , we turned a similar challenge into an historic opportunity and , i might add , an historic achievement .
an old order was in disarray ; political and economic institutions were shattered .
in that period , this nation and its partners built new institutions , new mechanisms of mutual support and cooperation .
today , as then , we face an historic opportunity .
if we act imaginatively and boldly , as we acted then , this period will in retrospect be seen as one of the great creative moments of our nation 's history .
the whole world is watching to see how we respond .
a resurgent american economy would do more to restore the confidence of the world in its own future than anything else we can do .
the program that this congress passes can demonstrate to the world that we have started to put our own house in order .
if we can show that this nation is able and willing to help other nations meet the common challenge , it can demonstrate that the united states will fulfill its responsibilities as a leader among nations .
quite frankly , at stake is the future of industrialized democracies , which have perceived their destiny in common and sustained it in common for 30 years .
the developing nations are also at a turning point .
the poorest nations see their hopes of feeding their hungry and developing their societies shattered by the economic crisis .
the long - term economic future for the producers of raw materials also depends on cooperative solutions .
our relations with the communist countries are a basic factor of the world environment .
we must seek to build a long - term basis for coexistence .
we will stand by our principles .
we will stand by our interests .
we will act firmly when challenged .
the kind of a world we want depends on a broad policy of creating mutual incentives for restraint and for cooperation .
as we move forward to meet our global challenges and opportunities , we must have the tools to do the job .
our military forces are strong and ready .
this military strength deters aggression against our allies , stabilizes our relations with former adversaries , and protects our homeland .
fully adequate conventional and strategic forces cost many , many billions , but these dollars are sound insurance for our safety and for a more peaceful world .
military strength alone is not sufficient .
effective diplomacy is also essential in preventing conflict , in building world understanding .
the vladivostok negotiations with the soviet union represent a major step in moderating strategic arms competition .
my recent discussions with the leaders of the atlantic community , japan , and south korea have contributed to meeting the common challenge .
but we have serious problems before us that require cooperation between the president and the congress .
by the constitution and tradition , the execution of foreign policy is the responsibility of the president .
in recent years , under the stress of the vietnam war , legislative restrictions on the president 's ability to execute foreign policy and military decisions have proliferated .
as a member of the congress , i opposed some and i approved others .
as president , i welcome the advice and cooperation of the house and the senate .
but if our foreign policy is to be successful , we can not rigidly restrict in legislation the ability of the president to act .
the conduct of negotiations is ill - suited to such limitations .
legislative restrictions , intended for the best motives and purposes , can have the opposite result , as we have seen most recently in our trade relations with the soviet union .
for my part , i pledge this administration will act in the closest consultation with the congress as we face delicate situations and troubled times throughout the globe .
when i became president only five months ago , i promised the last congress a policy of communication , conciliation , compromise , and cooperation .
i renew that pledge to the new members of this congress .
let me sum it up .
america needs a new direction , which i have sought to chart here today -- a change of course which will : put the unemployed back to work ; increase real income and production ; restrain the growth of federal government spending ; achieve energy independence ; and advance the cause of world understanding .
we have the ability .
we have the know - how .
in partnership with the american people , we will achieve these objectives .
as our 200th anniversary approaches , we owe it to ourselves and to posterity to rebuild our political and economic strength .
let us make america once again and for centuries more to come what it has so long been -- a stronghold and a beacon - light of liberty for the whole world .
thank you .

mr. chief justice , my dear friends , my fellow americans : 
 the oath that i have taken is the same oath that was taken by george washington and by every president under the constitution .
but i assume the presidency under extraordinary circumstances never before experienced by americans .
this is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts .
therefore , i feel it is my first duty to make an unprecedented compact with my countrymen .
not an inaugural address , not a fireside chat , not a campaign speech -- just a little straight talk among friends .
and i intend it to be the first of many .
i am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots , and so i ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers .
and i hope that such prayers will also be the first of many .
if you have not chosen me by secret ballot , neither have i gained office by any secret promises .
i have not campaigned either for the presidency or the vice presidency .
i have not subscribed to any partisan platform .
i am indebted to no man , and only to one woman -- my dear wife -- as i begin this very difficult job .
i have not sought this enormous responsibility , but i will not shirk it .
those who nominated and confirmed me as vice president were my friends and are my friends .
they were of both parties , elected by all the people and acting under the constitution in their name .
it is only fitting then that i should pledge to them and to you that i will be the president of all the people .
thomas jefferson said the people are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty .
and down the years , abraham lincoln renewed this american article of faith asking , " is there any better way or equal hope in the world ? "
i intend , on monday next , to request of the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate the privilege of appearing before the congress to share with my former colleagues and with you , the american people , my views on the priority business of the nation and to solicit your views and their views .
and may i say to the speaker and the others , if i could meet with you right after these remarks , i would appreciate it .
even though this is late in an election year , there is no way we can go forward except together and no way anybody can win except by serving the people 's urgent needs .
we can not stand still or slip backwards .
we must go forward now together .
to the peoples and the governments of all friendly nations , and i hope that could encompass the whole world , i pledge an uninterrupted and sincere search for peace .
america will remain strong and united , but its strength will remain dedicated to the safety and sanity of the entire family of man , as well as to our own precious freedom .
i believe that truth is the glue that holds government together , not only our government but civilization itself .
that bond , though strained , is unbroken at home and abroad .
in all my public and private acts as your president , i expect to follow my instincts of openness and candor with full confidence that honesty is always the best policy in the end .
my fellow americans , our long national nightmare is over .
our constitution works ; our great republic is a government of laws and not of men .
here the people rule .
but there is a higher power , by whatever name we honor him , who ordains not only righteousness but love , not only justice but mercy .
as we bind up the internal wounds of watergate , more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars , let us restore the golden rule to our political process , and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate .
in the beginning , i asked you to pray for me .
before closing , i ask again your prayers , for richard nixon and for his family .
may our former president , who brought peace to millions , find it for himself .
may god bless and comfort his wonderful wife and daughters , whose love and loyalty will forever be a shining legacy to all who bear the lonely burdens of the white house .
i can only guess at those burdens , although i have witnessed at close hand the tragedies that befell three presidents and the lesser trials of others .
with all the strength and all the good sense i have gained from life , with all the confidence my family , my friends , and my dedicated staff impart to me , and with the good will of countless americans i have encountered in recent visits to 40 states , i now solemnly reaffirm my promise i made to you last december 6 : to uphold the constitution , to do what is right as god gives me to see the right , and to do the very best i can for america .
god helping me , i will not let you down .
thank you .

mr. chairman , my distinguished colleagues : 
 may i begin by expressing to the governments of finland and switzerland , which have been superb hosts for the several phases of this conference , my gratitude and that of my associates for their efficiency and hospitality .
particularly to you , president kekkonen , i must convey to the people of the republic of finland , on behalf of the 214 million people of the united states of america , a reaffirmation of the longstanding affection and admiration which all my countrymen hold for your brave and beautiful land .
we are bound together by the most powerful of all ties , our fervent love for freedom and independence , which knows no homeland but the human heart .
it is a sentiment as enduring as the granite rock on which this city stands and as moving as the music of sibelius .
our visit here , though short , has brought us a deeper appreciation of the pride , industry , and friendliness which americans always associate with the finnish nation .
the nations assembled here have kept the general peace in europe for 30 years .
yet there have been too many narrow escapes from major conflict .
there remains , to this day , the urgent issue of how to construct a just and lasting peace for all peoples .
i have not come across the atlantic to say what all of us already know -- that nations now have the capacity to destroy civilization and , therefore , all our foreign policies must have as their one supreme objective the prevention of a thermonuclear war .
nor have i come to dwell upon the hard realities of continuing ideological differences , political rivalries , and military competition that persist among us .
i have come to helsinki as a spokesman for a nation whose vision has always been forward , whose people have always demanded that the future be brighter than the past , and whose united will and purpose at this hour is to work diligently to promote peace and progress not only for ourselves but for all mankind .
i am simply here to say to my colleagues : we owe it to our children , to the children of all continents , not to miss any opportunity , not to malinger for one minute , not to spare ourselves or allow others to shirk in the monumental task of building a better and a safer world .
the american people , like the people of europe , know well that mere assertions of good will , passing changes in the political mood of governments , laudable declarations of principles are not enough .
but if we proceed with care , with commitment to real progress , there is now an opportunity to turn our peoples ' hopes into realities .
in recent years , nations represented here have sought to ease potential conflicts .
but much more remains to be done before we prematurely congratulate ourselves .
military competition must be controlled .
political competition must be restrained .
crises must not be manipulated or exploited for unilateral advantages that could lead us again to the brink of war .
the process of negotiation must be sustained , not at a snail 's pace , but with demonstrated enthusiasm and visible progress .
nowhere are the challenges and the opportunities greater and more evident than in europe .
that is why this conference brings us all together .
conflict in europe shakes the world .
twice in this century we have paid dearly for this lesson ; at other times , we have come perilously close to calamity .
we dare not forget the tragedy and the terror of those times .
peace is not a piece of paper .
but lasting peace is at least possible today because we have learned from the experiences of the last 30 years that peace is a process requiring mutual restraint and practical arrangements .
this conference is a part of that process -- a challenge , not a conclusion .
we face unresolved problems of military security in europe ; we face them with very real differences in values and in aims .
but if we deal with them with careful preparation , if we focus on concrete issues , if we maintain forward movement , we have the right to expect real progress .
the era of confrontation that has divided europe since the end of the second world war may now be ending .
there is a new perception and a shared perception of a change for the better , away from confrontation and toward new possibilities for secure and mutually beneficial cooperation .
that is what we all have been saying here .
i welcome and i share these hopes for the future .
the postwar policy of the united states has been consistently directed toward the rebuilding of europe and the rebirth of europe 's historic identity .
the nations of the west have worked together for peace and progress throughout europe .
from the very start , we have taken the initiative by stating clear goals and areas for negotiation .
we have sought a structure of european relations , tempering rivalry with restraint , power with moderation , building upon the traditional bonds that link us with old friends and reaching out to forge new ties with former and potential adversaries .
in recent years , there have been some substantial achievements .
we see the four - power agreement on berlin of 1971 as the end of a perennial crisis that on at least three occasions brought the world to the brink of doom .
the agreements between the federal republic of germany and the states of eastern europe and the related intra - german accords enable central europe and the world to breathe easier .
the start of east - west talks on mutual and balanced force reductions demonstrate a determination to deal with military security problems of the continent .
the 1972 treaty between the united states and the soviet union to limit antiballistic missiles and the interim agreement limiting strategic offensive arms were the first solid breakthroughs in what must be a continuing , long - term process of limiting strategic nuclear arsenals .
i profoundly hope that this conference will spur further practical and concrete results .
it affords a welcome opportunity to widen the circle of those countries involved in easing tensions between east and west .
participation in the work of detente and participation in the benefits of detente must be everybody 's business -- in europe and elsewhere .
but detente can succeed only if everybody understands what detente actually is .
first , detente is an evolutionary process , not a static condition .
many formidable challenges yet remain .
second , the success of detente , of the process of detente , depends on new behavior patterns that give life to all our solemn declarations .
the goals we are stating today are the yardstick by which our performance will be measured .
the people of all europe and , i assure you , the people of north america are thoroughly tired of having their hopes raised and then shattered by empty words and unfulfilled pledges .
we had better say what we mean and mean what we say , or we will have the anger of our citizens to answer .
while we must not expect miracles , we can and we do expect steady progress that comes in steps -- steps that are related to each other that link our actions with words in various areas of our relations .
finally , there must be an acceptance of mutual obligation .
detente , as i have often said , must be a two - way street .
tensions can not be eased by one side alone .
both sides must want detente and work to achieve it .
both sides must benefit from it .
mr. chairman , my colleagues , this extraordinary gathering in helsinki proves that all our peoples share a concern for europe 's future and for a better and more peaceful world .
but what else does it prove ?
how shall we assess the results ?
our delegations have worked long and hard to produce documents which restate noble and praiseworthy political principles .
they spell out guidelines for national behavior and international cooperation .
but every signatory should know that if these are to be more than the latest chapter in a long and sorry volume of unfulfilled declarations , every party must be dedicated to making them come true .
these documents which we will sign represent another step -- how long or short a step only time will tell -- in the process of detente and reconcilation in europe .
our peoples will be watching and measuring our progress .
they will ask how these noble sentiments are being translated into actions that bring about a more secure and just order in the daily lives of each of our nations and its citizens .
the documents produced here represent compromises , like all international negotiations , but these principles we have agreed upon are more than the lowest common denominator of governmental positions .
they affirm the most fundamental human rights : liberty of thought , conscience , and faith ; the exercise of civil and political rights ; the rights of minorities .
they call for a freer flow of information , ideas , and people ; greater scope for the press , cultural and educational exchange , family reunification , the right to travel and to marriage between nationals of different states ; and for the protection of the priceless heritage of our diverse cultures .
they offer wide areas for greater cooperation : trade , industrial production , science and technology , the environment , transportation , health , space , and the oceans .
they reaffirm the basic principles of relations between states : nonintervention , sovereign equality , self - determination , territorial integrity , inviolability of frontiers , and the possibility of change by peaceful means .
the united states gladly subscribes to this document because we subscribe to every one of these principles .
almost 200 years ago , the united states of america was born as a free and independent nation .
the descendants of europeans who proclaimed their independence in america expressed in that declaration a decent respect for the opinions of mankind and asserted not only that all men are created equal but they are endowed with inalienable rights to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
the founders of my country did not merely say that all americans should have these rights but all men everywhere should have these rights .
and these principles have guided the united states of america throughout its two centuries of nationhood .
they have given hopes to millions in europe and on every continent .
i have been asked why i am here today .
i am here because i believe , and my countrymen believe , in the interdependence of europe and north america -- indeed in the interdependence of the entire family of man .
i am here because the leaders of 34 other governments are here -- the states of europe and of our good neighbor , canada , with whom we share an open border of 5,526 miles , along which there stands not a single armed soldier and across which our two peoples have moved in friendship and mutual respect for 160 years .
i can say without fear of contradiction that there is not a single people represented here whose blood does not flow in the veins of americans and whose culture and traditions have not enriched the heritage which we americans prize so highly .
when two centuries ago the united states of america issued a declaration of high principles , the cynics and doubters of that day jeered and scoffed .
yet 11 long years later , our independence was won and the stability of our republic was really achieved through the incorporation of the same principles in our constitution .
but those principles , though they are still being perfected , remain the guiding lights of an american policy .
and the american people are still dedicated , as they were then , to a decent respect for the opinions of mankind and to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness for all peoples everywhere .
to our fellow participants in this conference : my presence here symbolizes my country 's vital interest in europe 's future .
our future is bound with yours .
our economic well - being , as well as our security , is linked increasingly with yours .
the distance of geography is bridged by our common heritage and our common destiny .
the united states , therefore , intends to participate fully in the affairs of europe and in turning the results of this conference into a living reality .
to america 's allies : we in the west must vigorously pursue the course upon which we have embarked together , reinforced by one another 's strength and mutual confidence .
stability in europe requires equilibrium in europe .
therefore , i assure you that my country will continue to be a concerned and reliable partner .
our partnership is far more than a matter of formal agreements .
it is a reflection of beliefs , traditions , and ties that are of deep significance to the american people .
we are proud that these values are expressed in this document .
to the countries of the east : the united states considers that the principles on which this conference has agreed are a part of the great heritage of european civilization , which we all hold in trust for all mankind .
to my country , they are not cliches or empty phrases .
we take this work and these words very seriously .
we will spare no effort to ease tensions and to solve problems between us .
but it is important that you recognize the deep devotion of the american people and their government to human rights and fundamental freedoms and thus to the pledges that this conference has made regarding the freer movement of people , ideas , information .
in building a political relationship between east and west , we face many challenges .
berlin has a special significance .
it has been a flashpoint of confrontation in the past ; it can provide an example of peaceful settlement in the future .
the united states regards it as a test of detente and of the principles of this conference .
we welcome the fact that , subject to four - power rights and responsibilities , the results of csce apply to berlin as they do throughout europe .
military stability in europe has kept the peace .
while maintaining that stability , it is now time to reduce substantially the high levels of military forces on both sides .
negotiations now underway in vienna on mutual and balanced force reductions so far have not produced the results for which i had hoped .
the united states stands ready to demonstrate flexibility in moving these negotiations forward , if others will do the same .
an agreement that enhances mutual security is feasible -- and essential .
the united states also intends to pursue vigorously a further agreement on strategic arms limitations with the soviet union .
this remains a priority of american policy .
general secretary brezhnev and i agreed last november in vladivostok on the essentials of a new accord limiting strategic offensive weapons for the next 10 years .
we are moving forward in our bilateral discussions here in helsinki .
the world faces an unprecedented danger in the spread of nuclear weapons technology .
the nations of europe share a great responsibility for an international solution to this problem .
the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy are becoming more and more important .
we must find ways to spread these benefits while safeguarding the world against the menace of weapons proliferation .
to the other nations of europe represented at this conference : we value the work you have done here to help bring all of europe together .
your right to live in peace and independence is one of the major goals of our effort .
your continuing contribution will be indispensable .
to those nations not participating and to all the peoples of the world : the solemn obligation undertaken in these documents to promote fundamental rights , economic and social progress , and well - being applies ultimately to all peoples .
can we truly speak of peace and security without addressing the spread of nuclear weapons in the world or the creation of more sophisticated forms of warfare ?
can peace be divisible between areas of tranquillity and regions of conflict ?
can europe truly flourish if we do not all address ourselves to the evil of hunger in countries less fortunate than we ?
to the new dimensions of economic and energy issues that underline our own progress ?
to the dialog between producers and consumers , between exporters and importers , between industrial countries and less developed ones ?
and can there be stability and progress in the absence of justice and fundamental freedoms ?
our people want a better future .
their expectations have been raised by the very real steps that have already been taken -- in arms control , political negotiations , and expansion of contacts and economic relations .
our presence here offers them further hope .
we must not let them down .
if the soviet union and the united states can reach agreement so that our astronauts can fit together the most intricate scientific equipment , work together , and shake hands 137 miles out in space , we as statesmen have an obligation to do as well on earth .
history will judge this conference not by what we say here today , but by what we do tomorrow -- not by the promises we make , but by the promises we keep .
thank you very much , mr. chairman .

mr. speaker , mr. vice president , members of the 94th congress , and distinguished guests : as we begin our bicentennial , america is still one of the youngest nations in recorded history .
long before our forefathers came to these shores , men and women had been struggling on this planet to forge a better life for themselves and their families .
in man 's long , upward march from savagery and slavery -- throughout the nearly 2,000 years of the christian calendar , the nearly 6,000 years of jewish reckoning -- there have been many deep , terrifying valleys , but also many bright and towering peaks .
one peak stands highest in the ranges of human history .
one example shines forth of a people uniting to produce abundance and to share the good life fairly and with freedom .
one union holds out the promise of justice and opportunity for every citizen : that union is the united states of america .
we have not remade paradise on earth .
we know perfection will not be found here .
but think for a minute how far we have come in 200 years .
we came from many roots , and we have many branches .
yet all americans across the eight generations that separate us from the stirring deeds of 1776 , those who know no other homeland and those who just found refuge among our shores , say in unison : i am proud of america , and i am proud to be an american .
life will be a little better here for my children than for me .
i believe this not because i am told to believe it , but because life has been better for me than it was for my father and my mother .
i know it will be better for my children because my hands , my brains , my voice , and my vote can help make it happen .
it has happened here in america .
it has happened to you and to me .
government exists to create and preserve conditions in which people can translate their ideas into practical reality .
in the best of times , much is lost in translation .
but we try .
sometimes we have tried and failed .
always we have had the best of intentions .
but in the recent past , we sometimes forgot the sound principles that guided us through most of our history .
we wanted to accomplish great things and solve age - old problems .
and we became overconfident of our abilities .
we tried to be a policeman abroad and the indulgent parent here at home .
we thought we could transform the country through massive national programs , but often the programs did not work .
too often they only made things worse .
in our rush to accomplish great deeds quickly , we trampled on sound principles of restraint and endangered the rights of individuals .
we unbalanced our economic system by the huge and unprecedented growth of federal expenditures and borrowing .
and we were not totally honest with ourselves about how much these programs would cost and how we would pay for them .
finally , we shifted our emphasis from defense to domestic problems while our adversaries continued a massive buildup of arms .
the time has now come for a fundamentally different approach for a new realism that is true to the great principles upon which this nation was founded .
we must introduce a new balance to our economy -- a balance that favors not only sound , active government but also a much more vigorous , healthy economy that can create new jobs and hold down prices .
we must introduce a new balance in the relationship between the individual and the government -- a balance that favors greater individual freedom and self - reliance .
we must strike a new balance in our system of federalism -- a balance that favors greater responsibility and freedom for the leaders of our state and local governments .
we must introduce a new balance between the spending on domestic programs and spending on defense -- a balance that ensures we will fully meet our obligation to the needy while also protecting our security in a world that is still hostile to freedom .
and in all that we do , we must be more honest with the american people , promising them no more than we can deliver and delivering all that we promise .
the genius of america has been its incredible ability to improve the lives of its citizens through a unique combination of governmental and free citizen activity .
history and experience tells us that moral progress can not come in comfortable and in complacent times , but out of trial and out of confusion .
tom paine aroused the troubled americans of 1776 to stand up to the times that try men 's souls because the harder the conflict , the more glorious the triumph .
just a year ago i reported that the state of the union was not good .
tonight , i report that the state of our union is better -- in many ways a lot better -- but still not good enough .
to paraphrase tom paine , 1975 was not a year for summer soldiers and sum shine patriots .
it was a year of fears and alarms and of dire forecasts -- most of which never happened and wo n't happen .
as you recall , the year 1975 opened with rancor and with bitterness .
political misdeeds of the past had neither been forgotten nor forgiven .
the longest , most divisive war in our history was winding toward an unhappy conclusion .
many feared that the end of that foreign war of men and machines meant the beginning of a domestic war of recrimination and reprisal .
friends and adversaries abroad were asking whether america had lost its nerve .
finally , our economy was ravaged by inflation -- inflation that was plunging us into the worse recession in four decades .
at the same time , americans became increasingly alienated from big institutions .
they were steadily losing confidence , not just in big government but in big business , big labor , and big education , among others .
ours was a troubled land .
and so , 1975 was a year of hard decisions , difficult compromises , and a new realism that taught us something important about america .
it brought back a needed measure of common sense , steadfastness , and self - discipline .
americans did not panic or demand instant but useless cures .
in all sectors , people met their difficult problems with the restraint and with responsibility worthy of their great heritage .
add up the separate pieces of progress in 1975 , subtract the setbacks , and the sum total shows that we are not only headed in a new direction , a direction which i proposed 12 months ago , but it turned out to be the right direction .
it is the right direction because it follows the truly revolutionary american concept of 1776 , which holds that in a free society the making of public policy and successful problemsolving involves much more than government .
it involves a full partnership among all branches and all levels of government , private institutions , and individual citizens .
common sense tells me to stick to that steady course .
take the state of our economy .
last january , most things were rapidly getting worse .
this january , most things are slowly but surely getting better .
the worst recession since world war ii turned around in april .
the best cost - of - living news of the past year is that double - digit inflation of 12 percent or higher was cut almost in half .
the worst -- unemployment remains far too high .
today , nearly 1,700,000 more americans are working than at the bottom of the recession .
at year 's end , people were again being hired much faster than they were being laid off .
yet , let 's be honest .
many americans have not yet felt these changes in their daily lives .
they still see prices going up far too fast , and they still know the fear of unemployment .
we are also a growing nation .
we need more and more jobs every year .
today 's economy has produced over 85 million jobs for americans , but we need a lot more jobs , especially for the young .
my first objective is to have sound economic growth without inflation .
we all know from recent experience what runaway inflation does to ruin every other worthy purpose .
we are slowing it .
we must stop it cold .
for many americans , the way to a healthy , noninflationary economy has become increasingly apparent .
the government must stop spending so much and stop borrowing so much of our money .
more money must remain in private hands where it will do the most good .
to hold down the cost of living , we must hold down the cost of government .
in the past decade , the federal budget has been growing at an average rate of over 10 percent a year .
the budget i am submitting wednesday cuts this rate of growth in half .
i have kept my promise to submit a budget for the next fiscal year of $ 395 billion .
in fact , it is $ 394.2 billion .
by holding down the growth of federal spending , we can afford additional tax cuts and return to the people who pay taxes more decisionmaking power over their own lives .
last month i signed legislation to extend the 1975 tax reductions for the first six months of this year .
i now propose that effective july 1 , 1976 , we give our taxpayers a tax cut of approximately $ 10 billion more than congress agreed to in december .
my broader tax reduction would mean that for a family of four making $ 15,000 a year , there will be $ 227 more in take - home pay annually .
hardworking americans caught in the middle can really use that kind of extra cash .
my recommendations for a firm restraint on the growth of federal spending and for greater tax reduction are simple and straightforward .
for every dollar saved in cutting the growth in the federal budget , we can have an added dollar of federal tax reduction .
we can achieve a balanced budget by 1979 if we have the courage and the wisdom to continue to reduce the growth of federal spending .
one test of a healthy economy is a job for every american who wants to work .
government -- our kind of government -- can not create that many jobs .
but the federal government can create conditions and incentives for private business and industry to make more and more jobs .
five out of six jobs in this country are in private business and in industry .
common sense tells us this is the place to look for more jobs and to find them faster .
i mean real , rewarding , permanent jobs .
to achieve this we must offer the american people greater incentives to invest in the future .
my tax proposals are a major step in that direction .
to supplement these proposals , i ask that congress enact changes in federal tax laws that will speed up plant expansion and the purchase of new equipment .
my recommendations will concentrate this job - creation tax incentive in areas where the unemployment rate now runs over 7 percent .
legislation to get this started must be approved at the earliest possible date .
within the strict budget total that i will recommend for the coming year , i will ask for additional housing assistance for 500,000 families .
these programs will expand housing opportunities , spur construction , and help to house moderate- and low - income families .
we had a disappointing year in the housing industry in 1975 .
but with lower interest rates and available mortgage money , we can have a healthy recovery in 1976.a necessary condition of a healthy economy is freedom from the petty tyranny of massive government regulation .
we are wasting literally millions of working hours costing billions of taxpayers ' and consumers ' dollars because of bureaucratic redtape .
the american farmer , who now feeds 215 million americans , but also millions worldwide , has shown how touch more he can produce without the shackles of government control .
now , we badly need reforms in other key areas in our economy : the airlines , trucking , railroads , and financial institutions .
i have submitted concrete plans in each of these areas , not to help this or that industry , but to foster competition and to bring prices down for the consumer .
this administration , in addition , will strictly enforce the federal antitrust laws for the very same purposes .
taking a longer look at america 's future , there can be neither sustained growth nor more jobs unless we continue to have an assured supply of energy to run our economy .
domestic production of oil and gas is still declining .
our dependence on foreign oil at high prices is still too great , draining jobs and dollars away from our own economy at the rate of $ 125 per year for every american .
last month , i signed a compromise national energy bill which enacts a part of my comprehensive energy independence program .
this legislation was late , not the complete answer to energy independence , but still a start in the right direction .
i again urge the congress to move ahead immediately on the remainder of my energy proposals to make america invulnerable to the foreign oil cartel .
my proposals , as all of you know , would reduce domestic natural gas shortages ; allow production from federal petroleum reserves ; stimulate effective conservation , including revitalization of our railroads and the expansion of our urban transportation systems ; develop more and cleaner energy from our vast coal resources ; expedite clean and safe nuclear power production ; create a new national energy independence authority to stimulate vital energy investment ; and accelerate development of technology to capture energy from the sun and the earth for this and future generations .
also , i ask , for the sake of future generations , that we preserve the family farm and family - owned small business .
both strengthen america and give stability to our economy .
i will propose estate tax changes so that family businesses and family farms can be handed down from generation to generation without having to be sold to pay taxes .
i propose tax changes to encourage people to invest in america 's future , and their own , through a plan that gives moderate - income families income tax benefits if they make long - term investments in common stock in american companies .
the federal government must and will respond to clear - cut national needs -- for this and future generations .
hospital and medical services in america are among the best in the world , but the cost of a serious and extended illness can quickly wipe out a family 's lifetime savings .
increasing health costs are of deep concern to all and a powerful force pushing up the cost of living .
the burden of catastrophic illness can be borne by very few in our society .
we must eliminate this fear from every family .
i propose catastrophic health insurance for everybody covered by medicare .
to finance this added protection , fees for short - term care will go up somewhat , but nobody after reaching age 65 will have to pay more than $ 500 a year for covered hospital or nursing home care , nor more than $ 250 for one year 's doctor bills .
we can not realistically afford federally dictated national health insurance providing full coverage for all 215 million americans .
the experience of other countries raises questions about the quality as well as the cost of such plans .
but i do envision the day when we may use the private health insurance system to offer more middle - income families high quality health services at prices they can afford and shield them also from their catastrophic illnesses .
using resources now available , i propose improving the medicare and other federal health programs to help those who really need protection -- older people and the poor .
to help states and local governments give better health care to the poor , i propose that we combine 16 existing federal programs , including medicaid , into a single $ 10 billion federal grant .
funds would be divided among states under a new formula which provides a larger share of federal money to those states that have a larger share of low - income families .
i will take further steps to improve the quality of medical and hospital care for those who have served in our armed forces .
now let me speak about social security .
our federal social security system for people who have worked and contributed to it for all their lives is a vital part of our economic system .
its value is no longer debatable .
in my budget for fiscal year 1977 , i am recommending that the full cost - of - living increases in the social security benefits be paid during the coming year .
but i am concerned about the integrity of our social security trust fund that enables people -- those retired and those still working who will retire -- to count on this source of retirement income .
younger workers watch their deductions rise and wonder if they will be adequately protected in the future .
we must meet this challenge head on .
simple arithmetic warns all of us that the social security trust fund is headed for trouble .
unless we act soon to make sure the fund takes in as much as it pays out , there will be no security for old or for young .
i must , therefore , recommend a three - tenths of 1 percent increase in both employer and employee social security taxes effective january 1 , 1977 .
this will cost each covered employee less than one extra dollar a week and will ensure the integrity of the trust fund .
as we rebuild our economy , we have a continuing responsibility to provide a temporary cushion to the unemployed .
at my request , the congress enacted two extensions and two expansions in unemployment insurance which helped those who were jobless during 1975 .
these programs will continue in 1976.in my fiscal year 1977 budget , i am also requesting funds to continue proven job training and employment opportunity programs for millions of other americans .
compassion and a sense of community -- two of america 's greatest strengths throughout our history -- tell us we must take care of our neighbors who can not take care of themselves .
the host of federal programs in this field reflect our generosity as a people .
but everyone realizes that when it comes to welfare , government at all levels is not doing the job well .
too many of our welfare programs are inequitable and invite abuse .
too many of our welfare programs have problems from beginning to end .
worse , we are wasting badly needed resources without reaching many of the truly needy .
complex welfare programs can not be reformed overnight .
surely we can not simply dump welfare into the laps of the 50 states , their local taxpayers , or their private charities , and just walk away from it .
nor is it the right time for massive and sweeping changes while we are still recovering from the recession .
nevertheless , there are still plenty of improvements that we can make .
i will ask congress for presidential authority to tighten up the rules for eligibility and benefits .
last year i twice sought long overdue reform of the scandal - riddled food stamp program .
this year i say again : let 's give food stamps to those most in need .
let 's not give any to those who do n't need them .
protecting the life and property of the citizen at home is the responsibility of all public officials , but is primarily the job of local and state law enforcement authorities .
americans have always found the very thought of a federal police force repugnant , and so do i. but there are proper ways in which we can help to insure domestic tranquility as the constitution charges us .
my recommendations on how to control violent crime were submitted to the congress last june with strong emphasis on protecting the innocent victims of crime .
to keep a convicted criminal from committing more crimes , we must put him in prison so he can not harm more law - abiding citizens .
to be effective , this punishment must be swift and it must be certain .
too often , criminals are not sent to prison after conviction but are allowed to return to the streets .
some judges are reluctant to send convicted criminals to prison because of inadequate facilities .
to alleviate this problem at the federal level , my new budget proposes the construction of four new federal facilities .
to speed federal justice , i propose an increase this year in the united states attorneys prosecuting federal crimes and the reinforcement of the number of united states marshals .
additional federal judges are needed , as recommended by me and the judicial conference .
another major threat to every american 's person and property is the criminal carrying a handgun .
the way to cut down on the criminal use of guns is not to take guns away from the law - abiding citizen , but to impose mandatory sentences for crimes in which a gun is used , make it harder to obtain cheap guns for criminal purposes , and concentrate gun control enforcement in highcrime areas .
my budget recommends 500 additional federal agents in the 11 largest metropolitan high - crime areas to help local authorities stop criminals from selling and using handguns .
the sale of hard drugs is tragically on the increase again .
i have directed all agencies of the federal government to step up law enforcement efforts against those who deal in drugs .
in 1975 , i am glad to report , federal agents seized substantially more heroin coming into our country than in 1974.as president , i have talked personally with the leaders of mexico , colombia , and turkey to urge greater efforts by their governments to control effectively the production and shipment of hard drugs .
i recommended months ago that the congress enact mandatory fixed sentences for persons convicted of federal crimes involving the sale of hard drugs .
hard drugs , we all know , degrade the spirit as they destroy the body of their users .
it is unrealistic and misleading to hold out the hope that the federal government can move into every neighborhood and clean up crime .
under the constitution , the greatest responsibility for curbing crime lies with state and local authorities .
they are the frontline fighters in the war against crime .
there are definite ways in which the federal government can help them .
i will propose in the new budget that congress authorize almost $ 7 billion over the next five years to assist state and local governments to protect the safety and property of all their citizens .
as president , i pledge the strict enforcement of federal laws and -- by example , support , and leadership -- to help state and local authorities enforce their laws .
together , we must protect the victims of crime and ensure domestic tranquility .
last year i strongly recommended a five - year extension of the existing revenue sharing legislation , which thus far has provided $ 23 billion to help state and local units of government solve problems at home .
this program has been effective with decisionmaking transferred from the federal government to locally elected officials .
congress must act this year , or state and local units of government will have to drop programs or raise local taxes .
including my health care program reforms , i propose to consolidate some 59 separate federal programs and provide flexible federal dollar grants to help states , cities , and local agencies in such important areas as education , child nutrition , and social services .
this flexible system will do the job better and do it closer to home .
the protection of the lives and property of americans from foreign enemies is one of my primary responsibilities as president .
in a world of instant communications and intercontinental ballistic missiles , in a world economy that is global and interdependent , our relations with other nations become more , not less , important to the lives of americans .
america has had a unique role in the world since the day of our independence 200 years ago .
and ever since the end of world war ii , we have borne -- successfully -- a heavy responsibility for ensuring a stable world order and hope for human progress .
today , the state of our foreign policy is sound and strong .
we are at peace , and i will do all in my power to keep it that way .
our military forces are capable and ready .
our military power is without equal , and i intend to keep it that way .
our principal alliances with the industrial democracies of the atlantic community and japan have never been more solid .
a further agreement to limit the strategic arms race may be achieved .
we have an improving relationship with china , the world 's most populous nation .
the key elements for peace among the nations of the middle east now exist .
our traditional friendships in latin america , africa , and asia continue .
we have taken the role of leadership in launching a serious and hopeful dialog between the industrial world and the developing world .
we have helped to achieve significant reform of the international monetary system .
we should be proud of what america , what our country , has accomplished in these areas , and i believe the american people are .
the american people have heard too much about how terrible our mistakes , how evil our deeds , and how misguided our purposes .
the american people know better .
the truth is we are the world 's greatest democracy .
we remain the symbol of man 's aspiration for liberty and well - being .
we are the embodiment of hope for progress .
i say it is time we quit downgrading ourselves as a nation .
of course , it is our responsibility to learn the right lesson from past mistakes .
it is our duty to see that they never happen again .
but our greater duty is to look to the future .
the world 's troubles will not go away .
the american people want strong and effective international and defense policies .
in our constitutional system , these policies should reflect consultation and accommodation between the president and the congress .
but in the final analysis , as the framers of our constitution knew from hard experience , the foreign relations of the united states can be conducted effectively only if there is strong central direction that allows flexibility of action .
that responsibility clearly rests with the president .
i pledge to the american people policies which seek a secure , just , and peaceful world .
i pledge to the congress to work with you to that end .
we must not face a future in which we can no longer help our friends , such as angola , even in limited and carefully controlled ways .
we must not lose all capacity to respond short of military intervention .
some hasty actions of the congress during the past year -- most recently in respect to angola -- were , in my view , very shortsighted .
unfortunately , they are still very much on the minds of our allies and our adversaries .
a strong defense posture gives weight to our values and our views in international negotiations .
it assures the vigor of our alliances .
and it sustains our efforts to promote settlements of international conflicts .
only from a position of strength can we negotiate a balanced agreement to limit the growth of nuclear arms .
only a balanced agreement will serve our interests and minimize the threat of nuclear confrontation .
the defense budget i will submit to the congress for fiscal year 1977 will show an essential increase over the current year .
it provides for real growth in purchasing power over this year 's defense budget , which includes the cost of the all - volunteer force .
we are continuing to make economies to enhance the efficiency of our military forces .
but the budget i will submit represents the necessity of american strength for the real world in which we live .
as conflict and rivalry persist in the world , our united states intelligence capabilities must be the best in the world .
the crippling of our foreign intelligence services increases the danger of american involvement in direct armed conflict .
our adversaries are encouraged to attempt new adventures while our own ability to monitor events and to influence events short of military action is undermined .
without effective intelligence capability , the united states stands blindfolded and hobbled .
in the near future , i will take actions to reform and strengthen our intelligence community .
i ask for your positive cooperation .
it is time to go beyond sensationalism and ensure an effective , responsible , and responsive intelligence capability .
tonight i have spoken about our problems at home and abroad .
i have recommended policies that will meet the challenge of our third century .
i have no doubt that our union will endure , better , stronger , and with more individual freedom .
we can see forward only dimly -- one year , five years , a generation perhaps .
like our forefathers , we know that if we meet the challenges of our own time with a common sense of purpose and conviction , if we remain true to our constitution and to our ideals , then we can know that the future will be better than the past .
i see america today crossing a threshold , not just because it is our bicentennial but because we have been tested in adversity .
we have taken a new look at what we want to be and what we want our nation to become .
i see america resurgent , certain once again that life will be better for our children than it is for us , seeking strength that can not be counted in megatons and riches that can not be eroded by inflation .
i see these united states of america moving forward as before toward a more perfect union where the government serves and the people rule .
we will not make this happen simply by making speeches , good or bad , yours or mine , but by hard work and hard decisions made with courage and with common sense .
i have heard many inspiring presidential speeches , but the words i remember best were spoken by dwight d. eisenhower . "
america is not good because ' it is great , " the president said . "
america is great because it is good."president eisenhower was raised in a poor but religious home in the heart of america .
his simple words echoed president lincoln 's eloquent testament that " right makes might . "
and lincoln in turn evoked the silent image of george washington kneeling in prayer at valley forge .
so , all these magic memories which link eight generations of americans are summed up in the inscription just above me .
how many times have we seen it ? "
in god we trust."let us engrave it now in each of our hearts as we begin our bicentennial .

mr. speaker , mr. president , distinguished guests , my very dear friends : 
 in his first inaugural address , president franklin d. roosevelt said , and i quote : the people of the united states have not failed .... they want direct , vigorous action , and they have asked for discipline and direction under our leadership .
today , though our economic difficulties do not approach the emergency of 1933 , the message from the american people is exactly the same .
i trust that you are getting the very same message that i am receiving : our constituents want leadership , our constituents want action .
all of us have heard much talk on this very floor about congress recovering its rightful share of national leadership .
i now intend to offer you that chance .
the 73d congress responded to fdr 's appeal in five days .
i am deeply grateful for the cooperation of the 93d congress and the conference on inflation , which ended ten days ago .
mr. speaker , many -- but not all -- of your recommendations on behalf of your party 's caucus are reflected in some of my proposals here today .
the distinguished majority leader of the senate offered a nine - point program .
i seriously studied all of them and adopted some of his suggestions .
i might add , i have also listened very hard to many of our former colleagues in both bodies and of both the majority and the minority , and have been both persuaded and dissuaded .
but in the end , i had to make the decision , i had to decide , as each of you do when the roll call is called .
i will not take your time today with the discussion of the origins of inflation and its bad effect on the united states , but i do know where we want to be in 1976 -- on the 200th birthday of a united states of america that has not lost its way , nor its will , nor its sense of national purpose .
during the meetings on inflation , i listened carefully to many valuable suggestions .
since the summit , i have evaluated literally hundreds of ideas , day and night .
my conclusions are very simply stated .
there is only one point on which all advisers have agreed : we must whip inflation right now .
none of the remedies proposed , great or small , compulsory or voluntary , stands a chance unless they are combined in a considered package , in a concerted effort , in a grand design .
i have reviewed the past and the present efforts of our federal government to help the economy .
they are simply not good enough , nor sufficiently broad , nor do they pack the punch that will turn america 's economy on .
a stable american economy can not be sustained if the world 's economy is in chaos .
international cooperation is absolutely essential and vital .
but while we seek agreements with other nations , let us put our own economic house in order .
today , i have identified 10 areas for our joint action , the executive and the legislative branches of our government .
number one : food .
america is the world 's champion producer of food .
food prices and petroleum prices in the united states are primary inflationary factors .
america today partially depends on foreign sources for petroleum , but we can grow more than enough food for ourselves .
to halt higher food prices , we must produce more food , and i call upon every farmer to produce to full capacity .
and i say to you and to the farmers , they have done a magnificent job in the past , and we should be eternally grateful .
this government , however , will do all in its power to assure him -- that farmer -- he can sell his entire yield at reasonable prices .
accordingly , i ask the congress to remove all remaining acreage limitations on rice , peanuts , and cotton .
i also assure america 's farmers here and now that i will allocate all the fuel and ask authority to allocate all the fertilizer they need to do this essential job .
agricultural marketing orders and other federal regulations are being reviewed to eliminate or modify those responsible for inflated prices .
i have directed our new council on wage and price stability to find and to expose all restrictive practices , public or private , which raise food prices .
the administration will also monitor food production , margins , pricing , and exports .
we can and we shall have an adequate supply at home , and through cooperation , meet the needs of our trading partners abroad .
over this past weekend , we initiated a voluntary program to monitor grain exports .
the economic policy board will be responsible for determining the policy under this program .
in addition , in order to better allocate our supplies for export , i ask that a provision be added to public law 480 under which we ship food to the needy and friendly countries .
the president needs authority to waive certain of the restrictions on shipments based on national interest or humanitarian grounds .
number two : energy .
america 's future depends heavily on oil , gas , coal , electricity , and other resources called energy .
make no mistake , we do have a real energy problem .
one - third of our oil -- 17 percent of america 's total energy -- now comes from foreign sources that we can not control , at high cartel prices costing you and me $ 16 billion -- $ 16 billion more than just a year ago .
the primary solution has to be at home .
if you have forgotten the shortages of last winter , most americans have not .
i have ordered today the reorganization of our national energy effort and the creation of a national energy board .
it will be chaired with developing - or i should say charged with developing a single national energy policy and program .
and i think most of you will be glad to know that our former colleague , rog morton , our secretary of interior , will be the overall boss of our national energy program .
rog morton 's marching orders are to reduce imports of foreign oil by 1 million barrels per day by the end of 1975 , whether by savings here at home , or by increasing our own sources .
secretary morton , along with his other responsibility , is also charged with increasing our domestic energy supply by promptly utilizing our coal resources and expanding recovery of domestic oil still in the grounds in old wells .
new legislation will be sought after your recess to require use of cleaner coal processes and nuclear fuel in new electric plants , and the quick conversion of existing oil plants .
i propose that we , together , set a target date of 1980 for eliminating oil - fired plants from the nation 's base - loaded electrical capacity .
i will use the defense production act to allocate scarce materials for energy development , and i will ask you , the house and senate , for whatever amendments prove necessary .
i will meet with top management of the automobile industry to assure , either by agreement or by law , a firm program aimed at achieving a 40 percent increase in gasoline mileage within a 4-year development deadline .
priority legislation -- action , i should say -- to increase energy supply here at home requires the following : 
 one , long - sought deregulation of natural gas supplies , 
 number two , responsible use of our naval petroleum reserves in california and alaska , 
 number three , amendments to the clean air act ; and 
 four , passage of surface mining legislation to ensure an adequate supply with commonsense environmental protection .
now , if all of these steps fail to meet our current energy - saving goals , i will not hesitate to ask for tougher measures .
for the long range , we must work harder on coal gasification .
we must push with renewed vigor and talent research in the use of nonfossil fuels .
the power of the atom , the heat of the sun and the steam stored deep in the earth , the force of the winds and water must be main sources of energy for our grandchildren , and we can do it .
number three : restrictive practices .
to increase productivity and contain prices , we must end restrictive and costly practices whether instituted by government , industry , labor , or others .
and i am determined to return to the vigorous enforcement of antitrust laws .
the administration will zero in on more effective enforcement of laws against price fixing and bid rigging .
for instance , non - competitive professional fee schedules and real estate settlement fees must be eliminated .
such violations will be prosecuted by the department of justice to the full extent of the law .
now , i ask congress for prompt authority to increase maximum penalties for antitrust violations from $ 50,000 to $ 1 million for corporations , and from $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 for individual violators .
at the conference on inflation we found , i would say , very broad agreement that the federal government imposes too many hidden and too many inflationary costs on our economy .
as a result , i propose a four - point program aimed at a substantial purging process .
number one , i have ordered the council on wage and price stability to be the watchdog over inflationary costs of all governmental actions .
two , i ask the congress to establish a national commission on regulatory reform to undertake a long - overdue total reexamination of the independent regulatory agencies .
it will be a joint effort by the congress , the executive branch , and the private sector to identify and eliminate existing federal rules and regulations that increase costs to the consumer without any good reason in today 's economic climate .
three : hereafter , i will require that all major legislative proposals , regulations , and rules emanating from the executive branch of the government will include an inflation impact statement that certifies we have carefully weighed the effect on the nation .
i respectfully request that the congress require a similar advance inflation impact statement for its own legislative initiatives .
finally , i urge state and local units of government to undertake similar programs to reduce inflationary effects of their regulatory activities .
at this point , i thank the congress for recently revitalizing the national commission on productivity and work quality .
it will initially concentrate on problems of productivity in government -- federal , state , and local .
outside of government , it will develop meaningful blueprints for labor - management cooperation at the plant level .
it should look particularly at the construction and the health service industries .
the council on wage and price stability will , of course , monitor wage and price increases in the private sector .
monitoring will include public hearings to justify either price or wage increases .
i emphasize , in fact reemphasize , that this is not a compulsory wage and price control agency .
now , i know many americans see federal controls as the answer .
but i believe from past experience controls show us that they never really stop inflation -- not the last time , not even during and immediately after world war ii when , as i recall , prices rose despite severe and enforceable wartime rationing .
now , peacetime controls actually , we know from recent experience , create shortages , hamper production , stifle growth , and limit jobs .
i do not ask for such powers , however politically tempting , as such a program could cause the fixer and the black marketeer to flourish while decent citizens face empty shelves and stand in long waiting lines .
number four : we need more capital .
we can not " eat up our seed corn . "
our free enterprise system depends on orderly capital markets through which the savings of our people become productively used .
today , our capital markets are in total disarray .
we must restore their vitality .
prudent monetary restraint is essential .
you and the american people should know , however , that i have personally been assured by the chairman of the independent federal reserve board that the supply of money and credit will expand sufficiently to meet the needs of our economy and that in no event will a credit crunch occur .
the prime lending rate is going down .
to help industry to buy more machines and create more jobs , i am recommending a liberalized 10 percent investment tax credit .
this credit should be especially helpful to capital - intensive industries such as primary metals , public utilities , where capacity shortages have developed .
i am asking congress to enact tax legislation to provide that all dividends on preferred stocks issued for cash be fully deductible by the issuing company .
this should bring in more capital , especially for energy - producing utilities .
it will also help other industries shift from debt to equity , providing a sounder capital structure .
capital gains tax legislation must be liberalized as proposed by the tax reform bill currently before the committee on ways and means .
i endorse this approach and hope that it will pass promptly .
number five : helping the casualties .
and this is a very important part of the overall speech .
the conference on inflation made everybody even more aware of who is suffering most from inflation .
foremost are those who are jobless through no fault of their own .
three weeks ago , i released funds which , with earlier actions , provide public service employment for some 170,000 who need work .
i now propose to the congress a two - step program to augment this action .
first , 13 weeks of special unemployment insurance benefits would be provided to those who have exhausted their regular and extended unemployment insurance benefits , and 26 weeks of special unemployment insurance benefits to those who qualify but are not now covered by regular unemployment insurance programs .
funding in this case would come from the general treasury , not from taxes on employers as is the case with the established unemployment programs .
second , i ask the congress to create a brand new community improvement corps to provide work for the unemployed through short - term useful work projects to improve , beautify , and enhance the environment of our cities , our towns , and our countryside .
this standby program would come alive whenever unemployment exceeds 6 percent nationally .
it would be stopped when unemployment drops below 6 percent .
local labor markets would each qualify for grants whenever their unemployment rate exceeds 6.5 percent .
state and local government contractors would supervise these projects and could hire only those who had exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits .
the goal of this new program is to provide more constructive work for all americans , young or old , who can not find a job .
the purpose really follows this formula : short - term problems require short - term remedies .
i therefore request that these programs be for a 1-year period .
now , i know that low- and middle - income americans have been hardest hit by inflation .
their budgets are most vulnerable because a larger part of their income goes for the highly inflated costs of food , fuel , and medical care .
the tax reform bill now in the house committee on ways and means , which i favor , already provides approximately $ 1.6 billion of tax relief to these groups .
compensating new revenues are provided in this prospective legislation by a windfall tax , profits tax on oil producers , and by closing other loopholes .
if enacted , this will be a major contribution by the congress in our common effort to make our tax system fairer to all .
number six : stimulating housing .
without question , credit is the lifeblood of housing .
the united states , unfortunately , is suffering the longest and the most severe housing recession since the end of world war ii .
unemployment in the construction trades is twice the national average .
one of my first acts as president was to sign the housing and community development act of 1974 .
i have since concluded that still more help is needed , help that can be delivered very quickly and with minimum inflationary impact .
i urge the congress to enact before recess additional legislation to make most home mortgages eligible for purchase by an agency of the federal government .
as the law stands now , only fha or va home mortgages , one - fifth of the total , are covered .
i am very glad that the senate , thanks to the leadership of senator brooke and senator cranston , has already made substantial progress on this legislation .
as soon as it comes to me , i will make at least $ 3 billion immediately available for mortgage purchases , enough to finance about 100,000 more american homes .
number seven : thrift institutions .
savings and loan and similar institutions are hard hit by inflation and high interest rates .
they no longer attract , unfortunately , adequate deposits .
the executive branch , in my judgment , must join with the congress in giving critically needed attention to the structure and the operation of our thrift institutions which now find themselves for the third time in 8 years in another period of serious mortgage credit scarcity .
passage of the pending financial institution bill will help , but no single measure has yet appeared , as i see it , to solve feast or famine in mortgage credit .
however , i promise to work with you individually and collectively to develop additional specific programs in this area in the future .
number eight : international interdependency .
the united states has a responsibility not only to maintain a healthy economy at home , but also to seek policies which complement rather than disrupt the constructive efforts of others .
essential to u. s. initiatives is the early passage of an acceptable trade reform bill .
my special representative for trade negotiations departed earlier this afternoon to canada , europe , japan , to brief foreign friends on my proposals .
we live in an interdependent world and , therefore , must work together to resolve common economic problems .
number nine : federal taxes and spending .
to support programs , to increase production and share inflation - produced hardships , we need additional tax revenues .
i am aware that any proposal for new taxes just four weeks before a national election is , to put it mildly , considered politically unwise .
and i am frank to say that i have been earnestly advised to wait and talk about taxes anytime after november 5 .
but i do say in sincerity that i will not play politics with america 's future .
our present inflation to a considerable degree comes from many years of enacting expensive programs without raising enough revenues to pay for them .
the truth is that 19 out of the 25 years i had the honor and the privilege to serve in this chamber , the federal government ended up with federal deficits .
that is not a very good batting average .
by now , almost everybody -- almost everybody else , i should say -- has stated my position on federal gasoline taxes .
this time i will do it myself .
i am not - emphasizing not -- asking you for any increase in gas taxes .
i am -- i am asking you to approve a l - year temporary tax surcharge of 5 percent on corporate and upper - level individual incomes .
this would generally exclude from the surcharge those families with gross incomes below $ 15,000 a year .
the estimated $ 5 billion in extra revenue to be raised by this inflation - fighting tax should pay for the new programs i have recommended in this message .
i think , and i suspect each of you know , this is the acid test of our joint determination to whip inflation in america .
i would not ask this if major loopholes were not now being closed by the committee on ways and means ' tax reform bill .
i urge you to join me before your recess , in addition to what i have said before , to join me by voting to set a target spending limit -- let me emphasize it -- a target spending limit of $ 300 billion for the federal fiscal budget of 1975 .
when congress agrees to this spending target , i will submit a package of budget deferrals and rescissions to meet this goal .
i will do the tough job of designating for congressional action , on your return , those areas which i believe can and must be reduced .
these will be hard choices and every one of you in this chamber know it as well as i. they will be hard choices , but no federal agency , including the defense department , will be untouchable .
it is my judgment that fiscal discipline is a necessary weapon in any fight against inflation .
while this spending target is a small step , it is a step in the right direction , and we need to get on that course without any further delay .
i do not think that any of us in this chamber today can ask the american people to tighten their belts if uncle sam is unwilling to tighten his belt first .
and now , if i might , i would like to say a few words directly to your constituents and , incidentally , mine .
my fellow americans , 10 days ago i asked you to get things started by making a list of 10 ways to fight inflation and save energy , to exchange your list with your neighbors , and to send me a copy .
i have personally read scores of the thousands of letters received at the white house , and incidentally , i have made my economic experts read some of them , too .
we all benefited , at least i did , and i thank each and every one of you for this cooperation .
some of the good ideas from your home to mine have been cranked into the recommendations i have just made to the congress and the steps i am taking as president to whip inflation right now .
there were also firm warnings on what government must not do , and i appreciated those , too .
your best suggestions for voluntary restraint and self - discipline showed me that a great degree of patriotic determination and unanimity already exists in this great land .
i have asked congress for urgent specific actions it alone can take .
i advised congress of the initial steps that i am taking as president .
here is what only you can do : unless every able american pitches in , congress and i can not do the job .
winning our fight against inflation and waste involves total mobilization of america 's greatest resources -- the brains , the skills , and the willpower of the american people .
here is what we must do , what each and every one of you can do : to help increase food and lower prices , grow more and waste less ; to help save scarce fuel in the energy crisis , drive less , heat less .
every housewife knows almost exactly how much she spent for food last week .
if you can not spare a penny from your food budget -- and i know there are many -- surely you can cut the food that you waste by 5 percent .
every american motorist knows exactly how many miles he or she drives to work or to school every day and about how much mileage she or he runs up each year .
if we all drive at least 5 percent fewer miles , we can save , almost unbelievably , 250,000 barrels of foreign oil per day .
by the end of 1975 , most of us can do better than 5 percent by carpooling , taking the bus , riding bikes , or just plain walking .
we can save enough gas by self - discipline to meet our 1 million barrels per day goal .
i think there is one final thing that all americans can do , rich or poor , and that is share with others .
we can share burdens as we can share blessings .
sharing is not easy , not easy to measure like mileage and family budgets , but i am sure that 5 percent more is not nearly enough to ask , so i ask you to share everything you can and a little bit more .
and it will strengthen our spirits as well as our economy .
today i will not take more of the time of this busy congress , for i vividly remember the rush before every recess , and the clock is already running on my specific and urgent requests for legislative action .
i also remember how much congress can get done when it puts its shoulder to the wheel .
one week from tonight i have a long - standing invitation in kansas city to address the future farmers of america , a fine organization of wonderful young people whose help , with millions of others , is vital in this battle .
i will elaborate then how volunteer inflation fighters and energy savers can further mobilize their total efforts .
since asking miss sylvia porter , the well - known financial writer , to help me organize an all - out nationwide volunteer mobilization , i have named a white house coordinator and have enlisted the enthusiastic support and services of some 17 other distinguished americans to help plan for citizen and private group participation .
there will be no big federal bureaucracy set up for this crash program .
through the courtesy of such volunteers from the communication and media fields , a very simple enlistment form will appear in many of tomorrow 's newspapers along with the symbol of this new mobilization , which i am wearing on my lapel .
it bears the single word win .
i think that tells it all .
i will call upon every american to join in this massive mobilization and stick with it until we do win as a nation and as a people .
mr. speaker and mr. president , i stand on a spot hallowed by history .
many presidents have come here many times to solicit , to scold , to flatter , to exhort the congress to support them in their leadership .
once in a great while , presidents have stood here and truly inspired the most skeptical and the most sophisticated audience of their co - equal partners in government .
perhaps once or twice in a generation is there such a joint session .
i do n't expect this one to be .
only two of my predecessors have come in person to call upon congress for a declaration of war , and i shall not do that .
but i say to you with all sincerity that our inflation , our public enemy number one , will , unless whipped , destroy our country , our homes , our liberties , our property , and finally our national pride , as surely as any well - armed wartime enemy .
i concede there will be no sudden pearl harbor to shock us into unity and to sacrifice , but i think we have had enough early warnings .
the time to intercept is right now .
the time to intercept is almost gone .
my friends and former colleagues , will you enlist now ?
my friends and fellow americans , will you enlist now ?
together with discipline and determination , we will win .
i thank you very much .

mr. president , president hurley , senator johnston , my good friends from the house of representatives , eddie hebert , dave treen , lindy boggs , lieutenant governor fitzmorris , students , faculty , alumni , and guests of tulane university : 
 it is really a great privilege and a very high honor to have an opportunity of participating again in a student activity at tulane university .
and for this opportunity , i thank you very , very much .
each time that i have been privileged to visit tulane , i have come away newly impressed with the intense application of the student body to the great issues of our time , and i am pleased tonight to observe that your interest has n't changed one bit .
as we came into the building tonight , i passed a student who looked up from his book and said , " a journey of a thousand miles begins but with a single step . "
to indicate my interest in him , i asked , " are you trying to figure out how to get your goal in life ? "
he said , " no , i am trying to figure out how to get to the super dome in september . "
well , i do n't think there is any doubt in my mind that all of you will get to the super dome .
of course , i hope it is to see the green wave   have their very best season on the gridiron .
i have sort of a feeling that you would n't mind making this another year in which you put the tigers   in your tank .
when i had the privilege of speaking here in 1968 at your " directions ' 68 " forum , i had no idea that my own career and our entire nation would move so soon in another direction .
and i say again , i am extremely proud to be invited back .
i am impressed , as i undoubtedly said before -- but i would reiterate it tonight -- by tulane 's unique distinction as the only american university to be converted from state sponsorship to private status .
and i am also impressed by the tulane graduates who serve in the united states congress : bennett johnston , lindy boggs , dave treen .
eddie hebert , when i asked him the question whether he was or not , and he said he got a special degree : dropout ' 28 .
but i think the fact that you have these three outstanding graduates testifies to the academic excellence and the inspiration of this historic university , rooted in the past with its eyes on the future .
just as tulane has made a great transition from the past to the future , so has new orleans , the legendary city that has made such a unique contribution to our great america .
new orleans is more , as i see it , than weathered bricks and cast - iron balconies .
it is a state of mind , a melting pot that represents the very , very best of america 's evolution , an example of retention of a very special culture in a progressive environment of modern change .
on january 8 , 1815 , a monumental american victory was achieved here -- the battle of new orleans .
louisiana had been a state for less than three years , but outnumbered americans innovated , outnumbered americans used the tactics of the frontier to defeat a veteran british force trained in the strategy of the napoleonic wars .
we as a nation had suffered humiliation and a measure of defeat in the war of 1812 .
our national capital in washington had been captured and burned .
so , the illustrious victory in the battle of new orleans was a powerful restorative to our national pride .
yet , the victory at new orleans actually took place two weeks after the signing of the armistice in europe .
thousands died although a peace had been negotiated .
the combatants had not gotten the word .
yet , the epic struggle nevertheless restored america 's pride .
today , america can regain the sense of pride that existed before vietnam .
but it can not be achieved by refighting a war that is finished as far as america is concerned .
as i see it , the time has come to look forward to an agenda for the future , to unify , to bind up the nation 's wounds , and to restore its health and its optimistic self - confidence .
in new orleans , a great battle was fought after a war was over .
in new orleans tonight , we can begin a great national reconciliation .
the first engagement must be with the problems of today , but just as importantly , the problems of the future .
that is why i think it is so appropriate that i find myself tonight at a university which addresses itself to preparing young people for the challenge of tomorrow .
i ask that we stop refighting the battles and the recriminations of the past .
i ask that we look now at what is right with america , at our possibilities and our potentialities for change and growth and achievement and sharing .
i ask that we accept the responsibilities of leadership as a good neighbor to all peoples and the enemy of none .
i ask that we strive to become , in the finest american tradition , something more tomorrow than we are today .
instead of my addressing the image of america , i prefer to consider the reality of america .
it is true that we have launched our bicentennial celebration without having achieved human perfection , but we have attained a very remarkable self - governed society that possesses the flexibility and the dynamism to grow and undertake an entirely new agenda , an agenda for america 's third century .
so , i ask you to join me in helping to write that agenda .
i am as determined as a president can be to seek national rediscovery of the belief in ourselves that characterized the most creative periods in our nation 's history .
the greatest challenge of creativity , as i see it , lies ahead .
we , of course , are saddened indeed by the events in indochina .
but these events , tragic as they are , portend neither the end of the world nor of america 's leadership in the world .
let me put it this way , if i might .
some tend to feel that if we do not succeed in everything everywhere , then we have succeeded in nothing anywhere .
i reject categorically such polarized thinking .
we can and we should help others to help themselves .
but the fate of responsible men and women everywhere , in the final decision , rests in their own hands , not in ours .
america 's future depends upon americans -- especially your generation , which is now equipping itself to assume the challenges of the future , to help write the agenda for america .
earlier today , in this great community , i spoke about the need to maintain our defenses .
tonight , i would like to talk about another kind of strength , the true source of american power that transcends all of the deterrent powers for peace of our armed forces .
i am speaking here of our belief in ourselves and our belief in our nation .
abraham lincoln asked , in his own words , and i quote , " what constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence ? "
and he answered , " it is not our frowning battlements or bristling seacoasts , our army or our navy .
our defense is in the spirit which prized liberty as the heritage of all men , in all lands everywhere . "
it is in this spirit that we must now move beyond the discords of the past decade .
it is in this spirit that i ask you to join me in writing an agenda for the future .
i welcome your invitation particularly tonight , because i know it is at tulane and other centers of thought throughout our great country that much consideration is being given to the kind of future americans want and , just as importantly , will work for .
each of you are preparing yourselves for the future , and i am deeply interested in your preparations and your opinions and your goals .
however , tonight , with your indulgence , let me share with you my own views .
i envision a creative program that goes as far as our courage and our capacities can take us , both at home and abroad .
my goal is for a cooperative world at peace , using its resources to build , not to destroy .
as president , i am determined to offer leadership to overcome our current economic problems .
my goal is for jobs for all who want to work and economic opportunity for all who want to achieve .
i am determined to seek self - sufficiency in energy as an urgent national priority .
my goal is to make america independent of foreign energy sources by 1985 .
of course , i will pursue interdependence with other nations and a reformed international economic system .
my goal is for a world in which consuming and producing nations achieve a working balance .
i will address the humanitarian issues of hunger and famine , of health and of healing .
my goal is to achieve -- or to assure basic needs and an effective system to achieve this result .
i recognize the need for technology that enriches life while preserving our natural environment .
my goal is to stimulate productivity , but use technology to redeem , not to destroy our environment .
i will strive for new cooperation rather than conflict in the peaceful exploration of our oceans and our space .
my goal is to use resources for peaceful progress rather than war and destruction .
let america symbolize humanity 's struggle to conquer nature and master technology .
the time has now come for our government to facilitate the individual 's control over his or her future -- and of the future of america .
but the future requires more than americans congratulating themselves on how much we know and how many products that we can produce .
it requires new knowledge to meet new problems .
we must not only be motivated to build a better america , we must know how to do it .
if we really want a humane america that will , for instance , contribute to the alleviation of the world 's hunger , we must realize that good intentions do not feed people .
some problems , as anyone who served in the congress knows , are complex .
there are no easy answers .
willpower alone does not grow food .
we thought , in a well - intentioned past , that we could export our technology lock , stock , and barrel to developing nations .
we did it with the best of intentions .
but we are now learning that a strain of rice that grows in one place will not grow in another ; that factories that produce at 100 percent in one nation produce less than half as much in a society where temperaments and work habits are somewhat different .
yet , the world economy has become interdependent .
not only food technology but money management , natural resources and energy , research and development -- all kinds of this group require an organized world society that makes the maximum effective use of the world 's resources .
i want to tell the world : let 's grow food together , but let 's also learn more about nutrition , about weather forecasting , about irrigation , about the many other specialties involved in helping people to help themselves .
we must learn more about people , about the development of communities , architecture , engineering , education , motivation , productivity , public health and medicine , arts and sciences , political , legal , and social organization .
all of these specialities and many , many more are required if young people like you are to help this nation develop an agenda for our future -- your future , our country 's future .
i challenge , for example , the medical students in this audience to put on their agenda the achievement of a cure for cancer .
i challenge the engineers in this audience to devise new techniques for developing cheap , clean , and plentiful energy , and as a byproduct , to control floods .
i challenge the law students in this audience to find ways to speed the administration of equal justice and make good citizens out of convicted criminals .
i challenge education , those of you as education majors , to do real teaching for real life .
i challenge the arts majors in this audience to compose the great american symphony , to write the great american novel , and to enrich and inspire our daily lives .
america 's leadership is essential .
america 's resources are vast .
america 's opportunities are unprecedented .
as we strive together to prefect a new agenda , i put high on the list of important points the maintenance of alliances and partnerships with other people and other nations .
these do provide a basis of shared values , even as we stand up with determination for what we believe .
this , of course , requires a continuing commitment to peace and a determination to use our good offices wherever possible to promote better relations between nations of this world .
the new agenda , that which is developed by you and by us , must place a high priority on the need to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and to work for the mutual reduction in strategic arms and control of other weapons .
and i must say , parenthetically , the successful negotiations at vladivostok , in my opinion , are just a beginning .
your generation of americans is uniquely endowed by history to give new meaning to the pride and spirit of america .
the magnetism of an american society , confident of its own strength , will attract the good will and the esteem of all people wherever they might be in this globe in which we live .
it will enhance our own perception of ourselves and our pride in being an american .
we can , we can -- and i say it with emphasis -- write a new agenda for our future .
i am glad that tulane university and other great american educational institutions are reaching out to others in programs to work with developing nations , and i look forward with confidence to your participation in every aspect of america 's future .
and i urge americans of all ages to unite in this bicentennial year , to take responsibility for themselves as our ancestors did .
let us resolve tonight to rediscover the old virtues of confidence and stir - reliance and capability that characterized our forefathers two centuries ago .
i pledge , as i know you do , each one of us , to do our part .
let the beacon light of the past shine forth from historic new orleans and from tulane university and from every other corner of this land to illuminate a boundless future for all americans and a peace for all mankind .
thank you very much .

good morning : in my first week as president , i asked the attorney general and the secretary of defense to report to me , after consultation with other governmental officials and private citizens concerned , on the status of those young americans who have been convicted , charged , investigated , or are still being sought as draft evaders or military deserters .
on august 19 , at the national convention of veterans of foreign wars in the city of chicago , i announced my intention to give these young people a chance to earn their return to the mainstream of american society so that they can , if they choose , contribute , even though belatedly , to the building and the betterment of our country and the world .
i did this for the simple reason that for american fighting men , the long and divisive war in vietnam has been over for more than a year , and i was determined then , as now , to do everything in my power to bind up the nation 's wounds .
i promised to throw the weight of my presidency into the scales of justice on the side of leniency and mercy , but i promised also to work within the existing system of military and civilian law and the precedents set by my predecessors who faced similar postwar situations , among them presidents abraham lincoln and harry s. truman .
my objective of making future penalties fit the seriousness of each individual 's offense and of mitigating punishment already meted out in a spirit of equity has proved an immensely hard and very complicated matter , even more difficult than i knew it would be .
but the agencies of government concerned and my own staff have worked with me literally night and day in order to develop fair and orderly procedures and completed their work for my final approval over this last weekend .
i do not want to delay another day in resolving the dilemmas of the past , so that we may all get going on the pressing problems of the present .
therefore , i am today signing the necessary presidential proclamation and executive orders that will put this plan into effect .
the program provides for administrative disposition of cases involving draft evaders and military deserters not yet convicted or punished .
in such cases , 24 months of alternate service will be required , which may be reduced for mitigating circumstances .
the program also deals with cases of those already convicted by a civilian or military court .
for the latter purpose , i am establishing a clemency review board of nine distinguished americans whose duty it will be to assist me in assuring that the government 's forgiveness is extended to applicable cases of prior conviction as equitably and as impartially as is humanly possible .
the primary purpose of this program is the reconciliation of all our people and the restoration of the essential unity of americans within which honest differences of opinion do not descend to angry discord and mutual problems are not polarized by excessive passion .
my sincere hope is that this is a constructive step toward a calmer and cooler appreciation of our individual rights and responsibilities and our common purpose as a nation whose future is always more important than its past .
at this point , i will sign the proclamation   that i mentioned in my statement , followed by an executive order   for the establishment of the clemency board , followed by the signing of an executive order   for the director of selective service , who will have a prime responsibility in the handling of the matters involving alternate service .
thank you very much .

mr. speaker , mr. president , distinguished guests , my very good friends in the congress , and fellow americans : i stand before you tonight after many agonizing hours in very solemn prayers for guidance by the almighty .
in my report on the state of the union in january , i concentrated on two subjects which were uppermost in the minds of the american people -- urgent actions for the recovery of our economy and a comprehensive program to make the united states independent of foreign sources of energy .
i thank the congress for the action that it has taken thus far in my response for economic recommendations .
i look forward to early approval of a national energy program to meet our country 's long - range and emergency needs in the field of energy .
tonight it is my purpose to review our relations with the rest of the world in the spirit of candor and consultation which i have sought to maintain with my former colleagues and with our countrymen from the time that i took office .
it is the first priority of my presidency to sustain and strengthen the mutual trust and respect which must exist among americans and their government if we are to deal successfully with the challenges confronting us both at home and abroad .
the leadership of the united states of america since the end of world war ii has sustained and advanced the security , well - being , and freedom of millions of human beings besides ourselves .
despite some setbacks , despite some mistakes , the united states has made peace a real prospect for us and for all nations .
i know firsthand that the congress has been a partner in the development and in the support of american foreign policy , which five presidents before me have carried forward with changes of course but not of destination .
the course which our country chooses in the world today has never been of greater significance for ourselves as a nation and for all mankind .
we build from a solid foundation .
our alliances with great industrial democracies in europe , north america , and japan remain strong with a greater degree of consultation and equity than ever before .
with the soviet union we have moved across a broad front toward a more stable , if still competitive , relationship .
we have begun to control the spiral of strategic nuclear armaments .
after two decades of mutual estrangement , we have achieved an historic opening with the people 's republic of china .
in the best american tradition , we have committed , often with striking success , our influence and good offices to help contain conflicts and settle disputes in many , many regions of the world .
we have , for example , helped the parties of the middle east take the first steps toward living with one another in peace .
we have opened a new dialog with latin america , looking toward a healthier hemispheric partnership .
we are developing closer relations with the nations of africa .
we have exercised international leadership on the great new issues of our interdependent world , such as energy , food , environment , and the law of the sea .
the american people can be proud of what their nation has achieved and helped others to accomplish , but we have from time to time suffered setbacks and disappointments in foreign policy .
some were events over which we had no control ; some were difficulties we imposed upon ourselves .
we live in a time of testing and of a time of change .
our world -- a world of economic uncertainty , political unrest , and threats to the peace -- does not allow us the luxury of abdication or domestic discord .
i recall quite vividly the words of president truman to the congress when the united states faced a far greater challenge at the end of the second world war .
if i might quote : " if we falter in our leadership , we may endanger the peace of the world , and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation."president truman 's resolution must guide us today .
our purpose is not to point the finger of blame , but to build upon our many successes , to repair damage where we find it , to recover our balance , to move ahead as a united people .
tonight is a time for straight talk among friends , about where we stand and where we are going .
a vast human tragedy has befallen our friends in vietnam and cambodia .
tonight i shall not talk only of obligations arising from legal documents .
who can forget the enormous sacrifices of blood , dedication , and treasure that we made in vietnam?under five presidents and 12 congresses , the united states was engaged in indochina .
millions of americans served , thousands died , and many more were wounded , imprisoned , or lost .
over $ 150 billion have been appropriated for that war by the congress of the united states .
and after years of effort , we negotiated , under the most difficult circumstances , a settlement which made it possible for us to remove our military forces and bring home with pride our american prisoners .
this settlement , if its terms had been adhered to , would have permitted our south vietnamese ally , with our material and moral support , to maintain its security and rebuild after two decades of war .
the chances for an enduring peace after the last american fighting man left vietnam in 1973 rested on two publicly stated premises : first , that if necessary , the united states would help sustain the terms of the paris accords it signed 2 years ago , and second , that the united states would provide adequate economic and military assistance to south vietnam .
let us refresh our memories for just a moment .
the universal consensus in the united states at that time , late 1972 , was that if we could end our own involvement and obtain the release of our prisoners , we would provide adequate material support to south vietnam .
the north vietnamese , from the moment they signed the paris accords , systematically violated the cease - fire and other provisions of that agreement .
flagrantly disregarding the ban on the infiltration of troops , the north vietnamese illegally introduced over 350,000 men into the south .
in direct violation of the agreement , they sent in the most modern equipment in massive amounts .
meanwhile , they continued to receive large quantities of supplies and arms from their friends .
in the face of this situation , the united states -- torn as it was by the emotions of a decade of war -- was unable to respond .
we deprived ourselves by law of the ability to enforce the agreement , thus giving north vietnam assurance .
that it could violate that agreement with impunity .
next , we reduced our economic and arms aid to south vietnam .
finally , we signaled our increasing reluctance to give any support to that nation struggling for its survival .
encouraged by these developments , the north vietnamese , in recent months , began sending even their reserve divisions into south vietnam .
some 20 divisions , virtually their entire army , are now in south vietnam .
the government of south vietnam , uncertain of further american assistance , hastily ordered a strategic withdrawal to more defensible positions .
this extremely difficult maneuver , decided upon without consultations , was poorly executed , hampered by floods of refugees , and thus led to panic .
the results are painfully obvious and profoundly moving .
in my first public comment on this tragic development , i called for a new sense of national unity and purpose .
i said i would not engage in recriminations or attempts to assess the blame .
i reiterate that tonight .
in the same spirit , i welcome the statement of the distinguished majority leader of the united states senate earlier this week , and i quote : " it is time for the congress and the president to work together in the area of foreign as well as domestic policy."so , let us start afresh .
i am here to work with the congress .
in the conduct of foreign affairs , presidential initiative and ability to act swiftly in emergencies are essential to our national interest .
with respect to north vietnam , i call upon hanoi -- and ask the congress to join with me in this call -- to cease military operations immediately and to honor the terms of the paris agreement .
the united states is urgently requesting the signatories of the paris conference to meet their obligations to use their influence to halt the fighting and to enforce the 1973 accords .
diplomatic notes to this effect have been sent to all members of the paris conference , including the soviet union and the people 's republic of china .
the situation in south vietnam and cambodia has reached a critical phase requiring immediate and positive decisions by this government .
the options before us are few and the time is very short .
on the one hand , the united states could do nothing more ; let the government of south vietnam save itself and what is left of its territory , if it can ; let those south vietnamese civilians who have worked with us for a decade or more save their lives and their families , if they can ; in short , shut our eyes and wash our hands of the whole affair -- if we can .
or , on the other hand , i could ask the congress for authority to enforce the paris accords with our troops and our tanks and our aircraft and our artillery and carry the war to the enemy .
there are two narrower options : first , stick with my january request that congress appropriate $ 300 million for military assistance for south vietnam and seek additional funds for economic and humanitarian purposes .
or , increase my requests for both emergency military and humanitarian assistance to levels which , by best estimates , might enable the south vietnamese to stem the onrushing aggression , to stabilize the military situation , permit the chance of a negotiated political settlement between the north and south vietnamese , and if the very worst were to happen , at least allow the orderly evacuation of americans and endangered south vietnamese to places of safety .
let me now state my considerations and my conclusions .
i have received a full report from general weyand , whom i sent to vietnam to assess the situation .
he advises that the current military situation is very critical , but that south vietnam is continuing to defend itself with the resources available .
however , he feels that if there is to be any chance of success for their defense plan , south vietnam needs urgently an additional $ 722 million in very specific military supplies from the united states .
in my judgment , a stabilization of the military situation offers the best opportunity for a political solution .
i must , of course , as i think each of you would , consider the safety of nearly 6,000 americans who remain in south vietnam and tens of thousands of south vietnamese employees of the united states government , of news agencies , of contractors and businesses for many years whose lives , with their dependents , are in very grave peril .
there are tens of thousands of other south vietnamese intellectuals , professors , teachers , editors , and opinion leaders who have supported the south vietnamese cause and the alliance with the united states to whom we have a profound moral obligation .
i am also mindful of our posture toward the rest of the world and , particularly , of our future relations with the free nations of asia .
these nations must not think for a minute that the united states is pulling out on them or intends to abandon them to aggression .
i have therefore concluded that the national interests of the united states and the cause of world stability require that we continue to give both military and humanitarian assistance to the south vietnamese .
assistance to south vietnam at this stage must be swift and adequate .
drift and indecision invite far deeper disaster .
the sums i had requested before the major north vietnamese offensive and the sudden south vietnamese retreat are obviously inadequate .
half - hearted action would be worse than none .
we must act together and act decisively .
i am therefore asking the congress to appropriate without delay $ 722 million for emergency military assistance and an initial sum of $ 250 million for economic and humanitarian aid for south vietnam .
the situation in south vietnam is changing very rapidly , and the need for emergency food , medicine , and refugee relief is growing by the hour .
i will work with the congress in the days ahead to develop humanitarian assistance to meet these very pressing needs .
fundamental decency requires that we do everything in our power to ease the misery and the pain of the monumental human crisis which has befallen the people of vietnam .
millions have fled in the face of the communist onslaught and are now homeless and are now destitute .
i hereby pledge in the name of the american people that the united states will make a maximum humanitarian effort to help care for and feed these hopeless victims .
and now i ask the congress to clarify immediately its restrictions on the use of u. s. military forces in southeast asia for the limited purposes of protecting american lives by ensuring their evacuation , if this should be necessary .
and i also ask prompt revision of the law to cover those vietnamese to whom we have a very special obligation and whose lives may be endangered should the worst come to pass .
i hope that this authority will never have to be used , but if it is needed , there will be no time for congressional debate .
because of the gravity of the situation , i ask the congress to complete action on all of these measures not later than april 19.in cambodia , the situation is tragic .
the united states and the cambodian government have each made major efforts , over a long period and through many channels , to end that conflict .
but because of their military successes , steady external support , and their awareness of american legal restrictions , the communist side has shown no interest in negotiation , compromise , or a political solution .
and yet , for the past 3 months , the beleaguered people of phnom penh have fought on , hoping against hope that the united states would not desert them , but instead provide the arms and ammunition they so badly needed .
i have received a moving letter from the new acting president of cambodia , saukham khoy , and let me quote it for you:"dear mr. president , " he wrote , " as the american congress reconvenes to reconsider your urgent request for supplemental assistance for the khmer republic , i appeal to you to convey to the american legislators our plea not to deny these vital resources to us , if a nonmilitary solution is to emerge from this tragic 5-year - old conflict."to find a peaceful end to the conflict we need time .
i do not know how much time , but we all fully realize that the agony of the khmer people can not and must not go on much longer .
however , for the immediate future , we need the rice to feed the hungry and the ammunition and the weapons to defend ourselves against those who want to impose their will by force .
a denial by the american people of the means for us to carry on will leave us no alternative but inevitably abandoning our search for a solution which will give our citizens some freedom of choice as to their future .
for a number of years now the cambodian people have placed their trust in america .
i can not believe that this confidence was misplaced and that suddenly america will deny us the means which might give us a chance to find an acceptable solution to our conflict."this letter speaks for itself .
in january , i requested food and ammunition for the brave cambodians , and i regret to say that as of this evening , it may be soon too late .
members of the congress , my fellow americans , this moment of tragedy for indochina is a time of trial for us .
it is a time for national resolve .
it has been said that the united states is over - extended , that we have too many commitments too far from home , that we must reexamine what our truly vital interests are and shape our strategy to conform to them .
i find no fault with this as a theory , but in the real world such a course must be pursued carefully and in close coordination with solid progress toward overall reduction in worldwide tensions .
we can not , in the meantime , abandon our friends while our adversaries support and encourage theirs .
we can not dismantle our defenses , our diplomacy , or our intelligence capability while others increase and strengthen theirs .
let us put an end to self - inflicted wounds .
let us remember that our national unity is a most priceless asset .
let us deny our adversaries the satisfaction of using vietnam to pit americans against americans .
at this moment , the united states must present to the world a united front .
above all , let 's keep events in southeast asia in their proper perspective .
the security and the progress of hundreds of millions of people everywhere depend importantly on us .
let no potential adversary believe that our difficulties or our debates mean a slackening of our national will .
we will stand by our friends , we will honor our commitments , and we will uphold our country 's principles .
the american people know that our strength , our authority , and our leadership have helped prevent a third world war for more than a generation .
we will not shrink from this duty in the decades ahead .
let me now review with you the basic elements of our foreign policy , speaking candidly about our strengths and some of our difficulties .
we must , first of all , face the fact that what has happened in indochina has disquieted many of our friends , especially in asia .
we must deal with this situation promptly and firmly .
to this end , i have already scheduled meetings with the leaders of australia , new zealand , singapore , and indonesia , and i expect to meet with the leaders of other asian countries as well .
a key country in this respect is japan .
the warm welcome i received in japan last november vividly symbolized for both our peoples the friendship and the solidarity of this extraordinary partnership .
i look forward , as i am sure all of you do , with very special pleasure to welcoming the emperor when he visits the united states later this year .
we consider our security treaty with japan the cornerstone of stability in the vast reaches of asia and the pacific .
our relations are crucial to our mutual well - being .
together , we are working energetically on the international multilateral agenda -- in trade , energy , and food .
we will continue the process of strengthening our friendship , mutual security , and prosperity .
also , of course , of fundamental importance is our mutual security relationship with the republic of korea , which i reaffirmed on my recent visit .
our relations with europe have never been stronger .
there are no peoples with whom america 's destiny has been more closely linked .
there are no peoples whose friendship and cooperation are more needed for the future .
for none of the members of the atlantic community can be secure , none can prosper , none can advance unless we all do so together .
more than ever , these times demand our close collaboration in order to maintain the secure anchor of our common security in this time of international riptides , to work together on the promising negotiations with our potential adversaries , to pool our energies on the great new economic challenge that faces us .
in addition to this traditional agenda , there are new problems involving energy , raw materials , and the environment .
the atlantic nations face many and complex negotiations and decisions .
it is time to take stock , to consult on our future , to affirm once again our cohesion and our common destiny .
i therefore expect to join with the other leaders of the atlantic alliance at a western summit in the very near future .
before this nato meeting , i earnestly ask the congress to weigh the broader considerations and consequences of its past actions on the complex greek - turkish dispute over cyprus .
our foreign policy can not be simply a collection of special economic or ethnic or ideological interests .
there must be a deep concern for the overall design of our international actions .
to achieve this design for peace and to assure that our individual acts have some coherence , the executive must have some flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy .
united states military assistance to an old and faithful ally , turkey , has been cut off by action of the congress .
this has imposed an embargo on military purchases by turkey , extending even to items already paid for -- an unprecedented act against a friend .
these moves , i know , were sincerely intended to influence turkey in the cyprus negotiations .
i deeply share the concern of many citizens for the immense human suffering on cyprus .
i sympathize with the new democratic government in greece .
we are continuing our earnest efforts to find equitable solutions to the problems which exist between greece and turkey .
but the result of the congressional action has been to block progress towards reconciliation , thereby prolonging the suffering on cyprus , to complicate our ability to promote successful negotiations , to increase the danger of a broader conflict .
our longstanding relationship with turkey is not simply a favor to turkey ; it is a clear and essential mutual interest .
turkey lies on the rim of the soviet union and at the gates of the middle east .
it is vital to the security of the eastern mediterranean , the southern flank of western europe , and the collective security of the western alliance .
our u. s. military bases in turkey are as critical to our own security as they are to the defense of nato .
i therefore call upon the congress to lift the american arms embargo against our turkish ally by passing the bipartisan mansfield - scott bill now before the senate .
only this will enable us to work with greece and turkey to resolve the differences between our allies .
i accept and indeed welcome the bill 's requirement for monthly reports to the congress on progress toward a cyprus settlement , but unless this is done with dispatch , forces may be set in motion within and between the two nations which could not be reversed .
at the same time , in order to strengthen the democratic government of greece and to reaffirm our traditional ties with the people of greece , we are actively discussing a program of economic and military assistance with them .
we will shortly be submitting specific requests to the congress in this regard .
a vital element of our foreign policy is our relationship with the developing countries in africa , asia , and latin america .
these countries must know that america is a true , that america is a concerned friend , reliable both in word and deed .
as evidence of this friendship , i urge the congress to reconsider one provision of the 1974 trade act which has had an unfortunate and unintended impact on our relations with latin america , where we have such a long tie of friendship and cooperation .
under this legislation , all members of opec were excluded from our generalized system of trade preferences .
this , unfortunately , punished two south american friends , ecuador and venezuela , as well as other opec nations , such as nigeria and indonesia , none of which participated in last year 's oil embargo .
this exclusion has seriously complicated our new dialog with our friends in this hemisphere .
i therefore endorse the amendments which have been introduced in the congress to provide executive authority to waive those restrictions on the trade act that are incompatible with our national interest .
the interests of america as well as our allies are vitally affected by what happens in the middle east .
so long as the state of tension continues , it threatens military crisis , the weakening of our alliances , the stability of the world economy , and confrontation with the nuclear super powers .
these are intolerable risks .
because we are in the unique position of being able to deal with all the parties , we have , at their request , been engaged for the past year and a half in the peacemaking effort unparalleled in the history of the region .
our policy has brought remarkable successes on the road to peace .
last year , two major disengagement agreements were negotiated and implemented with our help .
for the first time in 30 years , a process of negotiation on the basic political issues was begun and is continuing .
unfortunately , the latest efforts to reach a further interim agreement between israel and egypt have been suspended .
the issues dividing the parties are vital to them and not amenable to easy and to quick solutions .
however , the united states will not be discouraged .
the momentum toward peace that has been achieved over the last 18 months must and will be maintained .
the active role of the united states must and will be continued .
the drift toward war must and will be prevented .
i pledge the united states to a major effort for peace in the middle east , an effort which i know has the solid support of the american people and their congress .
we are now examining how best to proceed .
we have agreed in principle to reconvene the geneva conference .
we are prepared as well to explore other forums .
the united states will move ahead on whatever course looks most promising , either towards an overall settlement or interim agreements , should the parties themselves desire them .
we will not accept stagnation or stalemate with all its attendant risks to peace and prosperity and to our relations in and outside of the region .
the national interest and national security require as well that we reduce the dangers of war .
we shall strive to do so by continuing to improve our relations with potential adversaries .
the united states and the soviet union share an interest in lessening tensions and building a more stable relationship .
during this process , we have never had any illusions .
we know that we are dealing with a nation that reflects different principles and is our competitor in many parts of the globe .
through a combination of firmness and flexibility , the united states , in recent years , laid the basis of a more reliable relationship , founded on mutual interest and mutual restraint .
but we can not expect the soviet union to show restraint in the face of the united states ' weakness or irresolution .
as long as i am president , america will maintain its strength , its alliances , and its principles as a prerequisite to a more peaceful planet .
as long as i am president , we will not permit detente to become a license to fish in troubled waters .
detente must be -- and , i trust , will be -- a two - way relationship .
central to u. s .- soviet relations today is the critical negotiation to control strategic nuclear weapons .
we hope to turn the vladivostok agreements into a final agreement this year at the time of general secretary brezhnev 's visit to the united states .
such an agreement would , for the first time , put a ceiling on the strategic arms race .
it would mark a turning point in postwar history and would be a crucial step in lifting from mankind the threat of nuclear war .
our use of trade and economic sanctions as weapons to alter the internal conduct of other nations must also be seriously reexamined .
however well - intentioned the goals , the fact is that some of our recent actions in the economic field have been self - defeating , they are not achieving the objectives intended by the congress , and they have damaged our foreign policy .
the trade act of 1974 prohibits most - favored - nation treatment , credit and investment guarantees and commercial agreements with the soviet union so long as their emigration policies fail to meet our criteria .
the soviet union has therefore refused to put into effect the important 1972 trade agreement between our two countries .
as a result , western europe and japan have stepped into the breach .
those countries have extended credits to the soviet union exceeding $ 8 billion in the last 6 months .
these are economic opportunities , jobs , and business which could have gone to americans .
there should be no illusions about the nature of the soviet system , but there should be no illusions about how to deal with it .
our belief in the right of peoples of the world freely to emigrate has been well demonstrated .
this legislation , however , not only harmed our relations with the soviet union but seriously complicated the prospects of those seeking to emigrate .
the favorable trend , aided by quiet diplomacy , by which emigration increased from 400 in 1968 to over 33,000 in 1973 has been seriously set back .
remedial legislation is urgently needed in our national interest .
with the people 's republic of china , we are firmly fixed on the course set forth in the shanghai communique .
stability in asia and the world require our constructive relations with one - fourth of the human race .
after two decades of mutual isolation and hostility , we have , in recent years , built a promising foundation .
deep differences in our philosophy and social systems will endure , but so should our mutual long - term interests and the goals to which our countries have jointly subscribed in shanghai .
i will visit china later this year to reaffirm these interests and to accelerate the improvement in our relations .
and i was glad to welcome the distinguished speaker and the distinguished minority leader of the house back today from their constructive visit to the people 's republic of china .
let me talk about new challenges .
the issues i have discussed are the most pressing of the traditional agenda on foreign policy , but ahead of us also is a vast new agenda of issues in an interdependent world .
the united states , with its economic power , its technology , its zest for new horizons , is the acknowledged world leader in dealing with many of these challenges .
if this is a moment of uncertainty in the world , it is even more a moment of rare opportunity .
we are summoned to meet one of man 's most basic challenges -- hunger .
at the world food conference last november in rome , the united states outlined a comprehensive program to close the ominous gap between population growth and food production over the long term .
our technological skill and our enormous productive capacity are crucial to accomplishing this task .
the old order -- in trade , finance , and raw materials -- is changing and american leadership is needed in the creation of new institutions and practices for worldwide prosperity and progress .
the world 's oceans , with their immense resources and strategic importance , must become areas of cooperation rather than conflict .
american policy is directed to that end .
technology must be harnessed to the service of mankind while protecting the environment .
this , too , is an arena for american leadership .
the interests and the aspirations of the developed and developing nations must be reconciled in a manner that is both realistic and humane .
this is our goal in this new era .
one of the finest success stories in our foreign policy is our cooperative effort with other major energy - consuming nations .
in little more than a year , together with our partners , we have created the international energy agency ; we have negotiated an emergency sharing arrangement which helps to reduce the dangers of an embargo ; we have launched major international conservation efforts ; we have developed a massive program for the development of alternative sources of energy .
but the fate of all of these programs depends crucially on what we do at home .
every month that passes brings us closer to the day when we will be dependent on imported energy for 50 percent of our requirements .
a new embargo under these conditions could have a devastating impact on jobs , industrial expansion , and inflation at home .
our economy can not be left to the mercy of decisions over which we have no control .
and i call upon the congress to act affirmatively .
in a world where information is power , a vital element of our national security lies in our intelligence services .
they are essential to our nation 's security in peace as in war .
americans can be grateful for the important but largely unsung contributions and achievements of the intelligence services of this nation .
it is entirely proper that this system be subject to congressional review .
but a sensationalized public debate over legitimate intelligence activities is a disservice to this nation and a threat to our intelligence system .
it ties our hands while our potential enemies operate with secrecy , with skill , and with vast resources .
any investigation must be conducted with maximum discretion and dispatch to avoid crippling a vital national institution .
let me speak quite frankly to some in this chamber and perhaps to some not in this chamber .
the central intelligence agency has been of maximum importance to presidents before me .
the central intelligence agency has been of maximum importance to me .
the central intelligence agency and its associated intelligence organizations could be of maximum importance to some of you in this audience who might be president at some later date .
i think it would be catastrophic for the congress or anyone else to destroy the usefulness by dismantling , in effect , our intelligence systems upon which we rest so heavily .
now , as congress oversees intelligence activities , it must , of course , organize itself to do so in a responsible way .
it has been traditional for the executive to consult with the congress through specially protected procedures that safeguard essential secrets .
but recently , some of those procedures have altered in a way that makes the protection of vital information very , very difficult .
i will say to the leaders of the congress , the house and the senate , that i will work with them to devise procedures which will meet the needs of the congress for review of intelligence agency activities and the needs of the nation for an effective intelligence service .
underlying any successful foreign policy is the strength and the credibility of our defense posture .
we are strong and we are ready and we intend to remain so .
improvement of relations with adversaries does not mean any relaxation of our national vigilance .
on the contrary , it is the firm maintenance of both strength and vigilance that makes possible steady progress toward a safer and a more peaceful world .
the national security budget that i have submitted is the minimum the united states needs in this critical hour .
the congress should review it carefully , and i know it will .
but it is my considered judgment that any significant reduction , revision , would endanger our national security and thus jeopardize the peace .
let no ally doubt our determination to maintain a defense second to none , and let no adversary be tempted to test our readiness or our resolve .
history is testing us today .
we can not afford indecision , disunity , or disarray in the conduct of our foreign affairs .
you and i can resolve here and now that this nation shall move ahead with wisdom , with assurance , and with national unity .
the world looks to us for the vigor and for the vision that we have demonstrated so often in the past in great moments of our national history .
and as i look down the road , i see a confident america , secure in its strengths , secure in its values , and determined to maintain both .
i see a conciliatory america , extending its hand to allies and adversaries alike , forming bonds of cooperation to deal with the vast problems facing us all .
i see a compassionate america , its heart reaching out to orphans , to refugees , and to our fellow human beings afflicted by war , by tyranny , and by hunger .
as president , entrusted by the constitution with primary responsibility for the conduct of our foreign affairs , i renew the pledge i made last august to work cooperatively with the congress .
i ask that the congress help to keep america 's word good throughout the world .
we are one nation , one government , and we must have one foreign policy .
in an hour far darker than this , abraham lincoln told his fellow citizens , and i quote : " we can not escape history .
we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves .
no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us."we who are entrusted by the people with the great decisions that fashion their future can escape neither responsibilities nor our consciences .
by what we do now , the world will know our courage , our constancy , and our compassion .
the spirit of america is good and the heart of america is strong .
let us be proud of what we have done and confident of what we can do .
and may god ever guide us to do what is right .
thank you .

i have come to a decision which i felt i should tell you and all of my fellow american citizens , as soon as i was certain in my own mind and in my own conscience that it is the right thing to do .
i have learned already in this office that the difficult decisions always come to this desk .
i must admit that many of them do not look at all the same as the hypothetical questions that i have answered freely and perhaps too fast on previous occasions .
my customary policy is to try and get all the facts and to consider the opinions of my countrymen and to take counsel with my most valued friends .
but these seldom agree , and in the end , the decision is mine .
to procrastinate , to agonize , and to wait for a more favorable turn of events that may never come or more compelling external pressures that may as well be wrong as right , is itself a decision of sorts and a weak and potentially dangerous course for a president to follow .
i have promised to uphold the constitution , to do what is right as god gives me to see the right , and to do the very best that i can for america .
i have asked your help and your prayers , not only when i became president but many times since .
the constitution is the supreme law of our land and it governs our actions as citizens .
only the laws of god , which govern our consciences , are superior to it .
as we are a nation under god , so i am sworn to uphold our laws with the help of god .
and i have sought such guidance and searched my own conscience with special diligence to determine the right thing for me to do with respect to my predecessor in this place , richard nixon , and his loyal wife and family .
theirs is an american tragedy in which we all have played a part .
it could go on and on and on , or someone must write the end to it .
i have concluded that only i can do that , and if i can , i must .
there are no historic or legal precedents to which i can turn in this matter , none that precisely fit the circumstances of a private citizen who has resigned the presidency of the united states .
but it is common knowledge that serious allegations and accusations hang like a sword over our former president 's head , threatening his health as he tries to reshape his life , a great part of which was spent in the service of this country and by the mandate of its people .
after years of bitter controversy and divisive national debate , i have been advised , and i am compelled to conclude that many months and perhaps more years will have to pass before richard nixon could obtain a fair trial by jury in any jurisdiction of the united states under governing decisions of the supreme court .
i deeply believe in equal justice for all americans , whatever their station or former station .
the law , whether human or divine , is no respecter of persons ; but the law is a respecter of reality .
the facts , as i see them , are that a former president of the united states , instead of enjoying equal treatment with any other citizen accused of violating the law , would be cruelly and excessively penalized either in preserving the presumption of his innocence or in obtaining a speedy determination of his guilt in order to repay a legal debt to society .
during this long period of delay and potential litigation , ugly passions would again be aroused .
and our people would again be polarized in their opinions .
and the credibility of our free institutions of government would again be challenged at home and abroad .
in the end , the courts might well hold that richard nixon had been denied due process , and the verdict of history would even more be inconclusive with respect to those charges arising out of the period of his presidency , of which i am presently aware .
but it is not the ultimate fate of richard nixon that most concerns me , though surely it deeply troubles every decent and every compassionate person .
my concern is the immediate future of this great country .
in this , i dare not depend upon my personal sympathy as a long - time friend of the former president , nor my professional judgment as a lawyer , and i do not .
as president , my primary concern must always be the greatest good of all the people of the united states whose servant i am .
as a man , my first consideration is to be true to my own convictions and my own conscience .
my conscience tells me clearly and certainly that i can not prolong the bad dreams that continue to reopen a chapter that is closed .
my conscience tells me that only i , as president , have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book .
my conscience tells me it is my duty , not merely to proclaim domestic tranquillity but to use every means that i have to insure it .
i do believe that the buck stops here , that i can not rely upon public opinion polls to tell me what is right .
i do believe that right makes might and that if i am wrong , 10 angels swearing i was right would make no difference .
i do believe , with all my heart and mind and spirit , that i , not as president but as a humble servant of god , will receive justice without mercy if i fail to show mercy .
finally , i feel that richard nixon and his loved ones have suffered enough and will continue to suffer , no matter what i do , no matter what we , as a great and good nation , can do together to make his goal of peace come true."now , therefore , i , gerald r. ford , president of the united states , pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by article ii , section 2 , of the constitution , have granted and by these presents do grant a full , free , and absolute pardon unto richard nixon for all offenses against the united states which he , richard nixon , has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from july   20 , 1969 through august 9 , 1974.""in witness whereof , i have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of september , in the year of our lord nineteen hundred and seventy - four , and of the independence of the united states of america the one hundred and ninety ninth . "

thank you very much , dr. kleinjans .
governor ariyoshi , senator fong , congressman matsunaga , dr. matsuda , students , faculty , and members of the community here in hawaii : it was nice to see you , doctor .
i had the honor for a good many years of representing an area , a wonderful community , from which the doctor came .
i know more of his relatives perhaps than he does----and they were always very kind to me , for which i was deeply grateful .
but it is good to be home again in the united states .
i have just completed , as many of you know , a 7-day trip to the state of alaska , to the people 's republic of china , to our good friends indonesia and the philippines , and now i am obviously happy to be home in our 50th state , hawaii .
this morning i reflected on the past at the shrine of americans who died on sunday morning 34 years ago .
i came away with a new spirit of dedication to the ideals that emerged from pearl harbor in world war ii -- dedication to america 's bipartisan policy of pursuing peace through strength and dedication to a new future of interdependence and cooperation with all peoples of the pacific .
i subscribe to a pacific doctrine of peace with all and hostility toward none .
the way i would like to remember or recollect pearl harbor is by preserving the power of the past to build the future .
let us join with new and old countries of that great pacific area in creating the greatest civilization on the shores of the greatest of our oceans .
my visit here to the east - west center holds another kind of meaning .
your center is a catalyst of america 's positive concern for asia , its people and its rich diversity of cultures .
you advance our hope that asia will gain a better understanding of the united states .
last year we were pleased to receive and to welcome nearly 54,000 asian students to the united states , while thousands upon thousands of american students went to asian countries .
i applaud your contribution to partnership in education .
your efforts represent america 's vision of an open world of understanding , freedom , and peace .
in hawaii , the crossroads of the pacific , our past and our future join .
i was deeply moved when i visited japan last year and when i recently had the honor of welcoming the emperor and the empress of japan to america .
the gracious welcome that i received and the warmth of the welcome the american people bestowed upon the emperor and the empress testify to a growing friendship and partnership between our two great countries .
this is a tribute to what is best in man -- his capacity to grow from fear to trust and from a tragedy of the past to a hopeful future .
it is a superb example of what can be achieved in human progress .
it inspires our new efforts in asia to improve relations .
america , a nation of the pacific basin , has a very vital stake in asia and a responsibility to take a leading part in lessening tensions , preventing hostilities , and preserving peace .
world stability and our own security depend upon our asian commitments .
in 1941 , 34 years ago today , we were militarily unprepared .
our trade in the pacific was very limited .
we exercised jurisdiction over the philippines .
we were preoccupied with western europe .
our instincts were isolationist .
we have transcended that age .
we are now the world 's strongest nation .
our great commercial involvement in asia is expanding .
we led the way in conferring independence upon the philippines .
now we are working out new associations and arrangements with the trust territories of the pacific .
the center of political power in the united states has shifted westward .
our pacific interests and concerns have increased .
we have exchanged the freedom of action of an isolationist state for the responsibilities of a great global power .
as i return from this trip to three major asian countries , i am even more aware of our interests in this part of the world .
the security concerns of great world powers intersect in asia .
the united states , the soviet union , china , and japan are all pacific powers .
western europe has historic and economic ties with asia .
equilibrium in the pacific is absolutely essential to the united states and to the other countries in the pacific .
the first premise of a new pacific doctrine is that american strength is basic to any stable balance of power in the pacific .
we must reach beyond our concern for security .
but without security , there can be neither peace nor progress .
the preservation of the sovereignty and the independence of our asian friends and allies remain a paramount objective of american policy .
we recognize that force alone is insufficient to assure security .
popular legitimacy and social justice are vital prerequisites of resistance against subversion or aggression .
nevertheless , we owe it to ourselves and to those whose independence depends upon our continued support to preserve a flexible and balanced position of strength throughout the pacific .
the second basic premise of a new pacific doctrine is that partnership with japan is a pillar of our strategy .
there is no relationship to which i have devoted more attention , nor is there any greater success story in the history of american efforts to relate to distant cultures and to people .
the japanese - american relationship can be a source of great , great pride to every american and to every japanese .
our bilateral relations have never been better .
the recent exchange of visits symbolized a basic political partnership .
we have begun to develop with the japanese and other advanced industrial democracies better means of harmonizing our economic policy .
we are joining with japan , our european friends , and representatives of the developing nations this month to begin shaping a more efficient and more equitable pattern of north - south economic relations .
the third premise of a new pacific doctrine is the normalization of relations with the people 's republic of china , the strengthening of our new ties with this great nation representing nearly one - quarter of mankind .
this is another recent achievement of american foreign policy .
it transcends 25 years of hostility .
i visited china to build on the dialog started nearly 4 years ago .
my wide - ranging exchanges with the leaders of the people 's republic of china -- with chairman mao tse - tung and vice premier teng hsiao - ping -- enhanced our understanding of each other 's views and each other 's policies .
there were , as expected , differences of perspective .
our societies , our philosophies , our varying positions in the world give us differing perceptions of our respective national interests .
but we did find a common ground .
we reaffirmed that we share very important areas of concern and agreement .
they say and we say that the countries of asia should be free to develop in a world where there is mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states ; where people are free from the threat of foreign aggression ; where there is noninterference in the internal affairs of others ; and where the principles of equality , mutual benefit , .and coexistence shape the development of peaceful international order .
we share opposition to any form of hegemony in asia or in any other part of the world .
i reaffirmed the determination of the united states to complete the normalization of relations with the people 's republic of china on the basis of the shanghai communique .
both sides regarded our discussions as significant , useful , and constructive .
our relationship is becoming a permanent feature of the international political landscape .
it benefits not only our two peoples but all peoples of the region and the entire world .
a fourth principle of our pacific policy is our continuing stake in stability and security in southeast asia .
after leaving china , i visited indonesia and the philippines .
indonesia is a nation of 140 million people , the fifth largest population in the world today .
it is one of our important new friends and a major country in that area of the world .
the republic of the philippines is one of our oldest and dearest allies .
our friendship demonstrates america 's longstanding interest in asia .
i spentthree days in djakarta and manila .
i would have liked to have had time to visit our friends in thailand , singapore , and malaysia .
we share important political .
and economic concerns with these five nations who make up the association of southeast asian nations .
i can assure you that americans will be hearing much more about the asean organization .
all of its members are friends of the united states .
their total population equals our own .
while they are developing countries , they possess many , many assets -- vital peoples , abundant natural resources , and well - mannered agricultures .
they have skilled leaders and the determination to develop themselves and to solve their own problems .
each of these countries protects its independence by relying on its own national resilience and diplomacy .
we must continue to assist them .
i learned during my visit that our friends want us to remain actively engaged in the affairs of the region .
we intend to do so .
we retain close and valuable ties with our old friends and allies in the southwest pacific -- australia on the one hand and new zealand on the other .
a fifth tenet of our new pacific policy is our belief that peace in asia depends upon a resolution of outstanding political conflicts .
in korea , tension persists .
we have close ties with the republic of korea .
and we remain committed to peace and security on the korean peninsula , as the presence of our forces there attests .
responding to the heightened tension last spring , we reaffirmed our support of the republic of korea .
today , the united states is ready to consider constructive ways of easing tensions on the peninsula .
but we will continue to resist any moves which attempt to exclude the republic of korea from discussion of its own future .
in indochina , the healing effects of time are required .
our policies toward the new regimes of the peninsula will be determined by their conduct toward us .
we are prepared to reciprocate gestures of good will -- particularly the return of remains of americans killed or missing in action or information about them .
if they exhibit restraint toward their neighbors and constructive approaches to international problems , we will look to the future rather than to the past .
the sixth point of our new policy in the pacific is that peace in asia requires a structure of economic cooperation reflecting the aspiration of all the peoples in the region .
the asian - pacific economy has recently achieved more rapid growth than any other region in the world .
our trade with east asia now exceeds our transactions with the european community .
america 's jobs , currency , and raw materials depend upon economic ties with the pacific basin .
our trade with the region is now increasing by more than 30 percent annually , reaching some $ 46 billion last year .
our economies are increasingly interdependent as cooperation grows between developed and developing nations .
our relations with the five asean countries are marked by growing maturity and by more modest and more realistic expectations on both sides .
we no longer approach them as donor to dependent .
these proud people look to us less for outright aid than for new trading opportunities and more equitable arrangements for the transfer of science and technology .
there is one common theme which was expressed to me by the leaders of every asian country that i visited .
they all advocate the continuity of steady and responsible american leadership .
they seek self - reliance in their own future and in their own relations with us .
our military assistance to allies and friends is a modest responsibility , but its political significance far surpasses the small cost involved .
we serve our highest national interests by strengthening their self - reliance , their relations with us , their solidarity with each other , and their regional security .
i emphasized to every leader i met that the united states is a pacific nation .
i pledged , as president , i will continue america 's active concern for asia and our presence in the asian - pacific region .
asia is entering a new era .
we can contribute to a new structure of stability founded on a balance among the major powers , strong ties to our allies in the region , an easing of tension between adversaries , the stir - reliance and regional solidarity of smaller nations , and expanding economic ties and cultural exchanges .
these components of peace are already evident .
our foreign policy in recent years and in recent days encourages their growth .
if we can remain steadfast , historians will look back and view the 1970 's as the beginning of a period of peaceful cooperation and progress , a time of growing community for all the nations touched by this great ocean .
here in the pacific crossroads of hawaii , we envision hope for a wider community of man .
we see the promise of a unique republic which includes all the world 's races .
no other country has been so truly a free , multiracial society .
hawaii is a splendid example , a splendid showcase of america and exemplifies our destiny as a pacific nation .
america 's pacific heritage emerged from this remarkable state .
i am proud to visit hawaii -- the island star in the american firmament which radiates the universal magic of aloha .
let there flow from hawaii -- and from all of the states in our union -- to all peoples , east and west , a new spirit of interchange to build human brotherhood .
thank you very much .
