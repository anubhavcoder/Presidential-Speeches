in april 1928 , as a result of discussions between our secretary of state of the united states and the minister of foreign affairs of france , the president directed secretary kellogg to propose to the nations of the world that they should enter into a binding agreement as follows:"article 1 - -the high contracting parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies , and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another."article 2 - -the high contracting parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be , which may arise among them , shall never be sought except by pacific means."that was a proposal to the conscience and idealism of civilized nations .
it suggested a new step in international law , rich with meaning , pregnant with new ideas in the conduct of world relations .
it represented a platform from which there is instant appeal to the public opinion of the world as to specific acts and deeds .
the magnificent response of the world to these proposals is well indicated by those now signatory to its provisions .
under the terms of the treaty there have been deposited in washington the ratifications of the 15 signatory nations -- that is , australia , belgium , canada , czechoslovakia , france , germany , great britain , india , irish free state , italy , japan , new zealand , poland , union of south africa , and the united states of america .
beyond this the treaty has today become effective also with respect to 31 other countries , the governments of which have deposited with the government of the united states instruments evidencing their definitive adherence to the treaty .
these countries are : afghanistan , albania , austria , bulgaria , china , cuba , denmark , dominican republic , egypt , estonia , ethiopia , finland , guatemala , hungary , iceland , latvia , [ p.234 ] liberia , lithuania , the netherlands , nicaragua , norway , panama , portugal , peru , rumania , russia , kingdom of the serbs , croats and slovenes , siam , spain , sweden , and turkey .
moreover , according to information received through diplomatic channels , the instruments of definitive adherence of greece , honduras , persia , switzerland , and venezuela have been fully completed according to their constitutional methods and are now on the way to washington for deposit .
i congratulate this assembly , the states it represents , and indeed , the entire world upon the coming into force of this additional instrument of humane endeavor to do away with war as an instrument of national policy and to obtain by pacific means alone the settlement of international disputes .
i am glad of this opportunity to pay merited tribute to the two statesmen whose names the world has properly adopted in its designation of this treaty .
to aristide briand , minister of foreign affairs of france , we owe the inception of the treaty and to his zeal is due a very large share of the success which attended the subsequent negotiations .
to frank b. kellogg , then secretary of state of the united states , we owe its expansion to the proportions of a treaty open to the entire world and destined , as i most confidently hope , shortly to include among its parties every country of the world .
mr. stimson has sent forward today a message of felicitation to m. briand and to the people of france for whom he speaks .
i am happy , mr. kellogg , to extend to you , who represented the people of the united states with such untiring devotion and with such a high degree of diplomatic skill in the negotiations of this treaty , their everlasting gratitude .
we are honored here by the presence of president coolidge under whose administration this great step in world peace was initiated .
under his authority and with his courageous support you , mr. kellogg , succeeded in this great service .
and i wish to mark also the high appreciation in which we hold senators borah and swanson for their leadership during its confirmation in the senate .
may i ask you who represent governments which have accepted this treaty , now a part of their supreme law and their most sacred obligations , to convey to them the high appreciation of the government of the united states that through their cordial collaboration an act so auspicious for the future happiness of mankind has now been consummated .
i dare predict that the influence of the treaty for the renunciation of war will be felt in a large proportion of all future international acts .
the magnificent opportunity and the compelling duty now open to us should spur us on to the fulfillment of every opportunity that is calculated to implement this treaty and to extend the policy which it so nobly sets forth .
i have today proclaimed the treaty to the american people in language as follows:"whereas a treaty between the president of the united states of america , the president of the german reich , his majesty the king of the belgians , the president of the french republic , his majesty the king of great britain , ireland and the british dominions beyond the seas , emperor of india , his majesty the king of italy , his majesty the emperor of japan , the president of the republic of poland , and the president of the czechoslovak republic , providing for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy and that the solution of disputes among parties shall never be sought except by pacific means , was concluded and signed by their respective plenipotentiaries at paris on august twenty - seven , 1928,"and whereas it is stipulated in the said treaty that it shall take effect as between the high contracting parties as soon as all the several instruments of ratification shall have been deposited at washington,"and whereas the said treaty has been duly ratified on the parts of all the high contracting parties and their several instruments of ratification have been deposited with the government of the united states of america , the last on july twenty - fourth , 1929;"now , therefore , be it known that i , herbert hoover , president of the united states of america , have caused the said treaty to be made public to the end that the same and every article and clause thereof may be observed and fulfilled with good faith by the united states and the citizens thereof."in testimony whereof , i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states of america to be affixed."done in the city of washington this twenty - fourth day of july in the year of our lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty - nine and of the independence of the united states of america the one hundred and fifty - fourth . "

" the departments of commerce and labor are engaged in the usual monthly survey of business and unemployment and especially of the results obtained from the measures which have been in progress since the last of november , to reduce unemployment and the hardship following the dislocation from the stock exchange crash .
the survey is not as yet complete .
there are , however , certain conclusions that are evident .
" 1 .
unemployment amounting to distress is in the main concentrated in 12 states .
the authorities in the remaining 36 states indicate only normal seasonal unemployment or that the minor abnormal unemployment is being rapidly absorbed .
" 2 .
the low point of business and employment was the latter part of december and early january .
since that time employment has been slowly increasing and the situation is much better today than at that time .
" 3 .
nationwide response to the request for increased construction and improvement work by public authorities , railroads , utilities , and industries is having a most material effect .
construction contracts in these categories in january and february were from 40 percent to 45 percent higher than ever known in those months .
the total construction work for 1930 seems assured to be larger than even 1929 .
" 4 .
the undertakings to maintain wages have been held .
" 5 .
the amount of unemployment is , in proportion to the number of workers , considerably less than one - half ( probably only one - third ) of that which resulted from the crashes of 1907 - 08 , and 1920 - 22 at this period of the situation .
" 6 .
measures taken to ameliorate interest rates have resulted in continuous decrease since december , and money is available at lower rates for business and commercial purposes .
one result is an increasing volume of bond issues have been placed for public improvements .
available money for mortgage purposes of home building and agriculture has lagged behind other forms of credit .
but a decrease in demands of policyholders for loans on the insurance companies and the action recently taken by the federal reserve system should result in increased supplies of credit , especially for residential building , which in turn has lagged behind other construction .
" 7 .
all the evidences indicate that the worst effects of the crash upon employment will have been passed during the next 60 days with the amelioration of seasonal unemployment , the gaining strength of other forces , and the continued cooperation of the many agencies actively cooperating with the government to restore business and to relieve distress . "

i shall approve the tariff bill .
this legislation has now been under almost continuous consideration by congress for nearly 15 months .
it was undertaken as the result of pledges given by the republican party at kansas city .
its declarations embraced these obligations : 
 " the republican party believes that the home market built up under the protective policy belongs to the american farmer , and it pledges its support of legislation which will give this market to him to the full extent of his ability to supply it . . . .
" there are certain industries which can not now successfully compete with foreign producers because of lower foreign wages and a lower cost of living abroad , and we pledge the next republican congress to an examination and where necessary a revision of these schedules to the end that the american labor in these industries may again command the home market , may maintain its standard of living , and may count upon steady employment in its accustomed field . "
platform promises must not be empty gestures .
in my message of april 16 , 1929 , to the special session of the congress i accordingly recommended an increase in agricultural protection ; a limited revision of other schedules to take care of the economic changes necessitating increases or decreases since the enactment of the 1922 law , and i further recommended a reorganization both of the tariff commission and of the method of executing the flexible provisions .
a statistical estimate of the bill by the tariff commission shows that the average duties collected under the 1922 law were about 13.8 percent of the value of all imports , both free and dutiable , while if the new law had been applied it would have increased this percentage to about 16.0 percent .
this compares with the average level of the tariff under : 
 the mckinley law of 23.0 % 
 the wilson law of 20.9 % 
 the dingley law of 25.8 % 
 the payne - aldrich law of 19.3 % 
 the fordney - mccumber law of 13.83 % 
 under the underwood law of 1913 the amounts were disturbed by war conditions varying 6 percent to 14.8 percent .
the proportion of imports which will be free of duty under the new law is estimated at from 61 to 63 percent .
this compares with averages under : 
 the mckinley law of 52.4 % 
 the wilson law of 49.4 % 
 the dingley law of 45.2 % 
 the payne - aldrich law of 52.5 % 
 the fordney - mccumber law of 63.8 % 
 under the underwood law of 1913 disturbed conditions varied the free list from 60 percent to 73 percent averaging 66.3 percent .
the increases in tariff are largely directed to the interest of the farmer .
of the increases , it is stated by the tariff commission that 93.73 percent are upon products of agricultural origin measured in value , as distinguished from 6.25 percent upon commodities of strictly nonagricultural origin .
the average rate upon agricultural raw materials shows an increase from 38.10 percent to 48.92 percent in contrast to dutiable articles of strictly other than agricultural origin which show an average increase of from 31.02 percent to 34.31 percent .
compensatory duties have necessarily been given on products manufactured from agricultural raw materials and protective rates added to these in some instances .
the extent of rate revision as indicated by the tariff commission is that in value of the total imports the duties upon approximately 22.5 percent have been increased , and 77.5 percent were untouched or decreased .
by number of the dutiable items mentioned in the bill , out of the total of about 3,300 , there were about 890 increased , 235 decreased , and 2,170 untouched .
the number of items increased was , therefore , 27 percent of all dutiable items , and compares with 83 percent of the number of items which were increased in the 1922 revision .
this tariff law is like all other tariff legislation , whether framed primarily .upon a protective or a revenue basis .
it contains many compromises between sectional interests and between different industries .
no tariff bill has ever been enacted or ever will be enacted under the present system that will be perfect .
a large portion of the items are always adjusted with good judgment , but it is bound to contain some inequalities and inequitable compromises .
there are items upon which duties will prove too high and others upon which duties will prove to be too low .
certainly no president , with his other duties , can pretend to make that exhaustive determination of the complex facts which surround each of those 3,300 items , and which has required the attention of hundreds of men in congress for nearly a year and a third .
that responsibility must rest upon the congress in a legislative rate revision .
on the administrative side i have insisted , however , that there should be created a new basis for the flexible tariff and it has been incorporated in this law .
thereby the means are established for objective and judicial review of these rates upon principles laid down by the congress , free from pressures inherent in legislative action .
thus , the outstanding step of this tariff legislation has been the reorganization of the largely inoperative flexible provision of 1922 into a form which should render it possible to secure prompt and scientific adjustment of serious inequities and inequalities which may prove to have been incorporated in the bill .
this new provision has even a larger importance .
if a perfect tariff bill were enacted today , the increased rapidity of economic change and the constant shifting of our relations to industries abroad will create a continuous stream of items which would work hardship upon some segment of the american people except for the provision of this relief .
without a workable flexible provision we would require even more frequent congressional tariff revision than during the past .
with it the country should be freed from further general revision for many years to come .
congressional revisions are not only disturbing to business but with all their necessary collateral surroundings in lobbies , log rolling , and the activities of group interests , are disturbing to public confidence .
under the old flexible provisions , the task of adjustment was imposed directly upon the president , and the limitations in the law which circumscribed it were such that action was long delayed and it was largely inoperative , although important benefits were brought to the dairying , flax , glass , and other industries through it .
the new flexible provision established the responsibility for revisions upon a reorganized tariff commission , composed of members equal of both parties as a definite rate making body acting through semi - judicial methods of open hearings and investigation by which items can be taken up one by one upon direction or upon application of aggrieved parties .
recommendations are to be made to the president , he being given authority to promulgate or veto the conclusions of the commission .
such revision can be accomplished without disturbance to business , as they concern but one item at a time , and the principles laid down assure a protective basis .
the principle of a protective tariff for the benefit of labor , industry , and the farmer is established in the bill by the requirement that the commission shall adjust the rates so as to cover the differences in cost of production at home and abroad , and it is authorized to increase or decrease the duties by 50 percent to effect this end .
the means and methods of ascertaining such differences by the commission are provided in such fashion as should expedite prompt and effective action if grievances develop .
when the flexible principle was first written into law in 1922 , by tradition and force of habit the old conception of legislative revision was so firmly fixed that the innovation was bound to be used with caution and in a restricted field , even had it not been largely inoperative for other reasons .
now , however , and particularly after the record of the last 15 months , there is a growing and widespread realization that in this highly complicated and intricately organized and rapidly shifting modern economic world , the time has come when a more scientific and businesslike method of tariff revision must be devised .
toward this the new flexible provision takes a long step .
these provisions meet the repeated demands of statesmen and industrial and agricultural leaders over the past 25 years .
it complies in full degree with the proposals made 20 years ago by president roosevelt .
it now covers proposals which i urged in 1922 .
if , however , by any chance the flexible provisions now made should prove insufficient for effective action , i shall ask for further authority for the commission , for i believe that public opinion will give wholehearted support to the carrying out of such a program on a generous scale to the end that we may develop a protective system free from the vices which have characterized every tariff revision in the past .
the complaints from some foreign countries that these duties have been placed unduly high can be remedied , if justified , by proper application to the tariff commission .
it is urgent that the uncertainties in the business world which have been added to by the long - extended debate of the measure should be ended .
they can be ended only by completion of this bill .
meritorious demands for further protection to agriculture and labor which have developed since the tariff of 1922 would not end if this bill fails of enactment .
agitation for legislative tariff revision would necessarily continue before the country .
nothing would contribute to retard business recovery more than this continued agitation .
as i have said , i do not assume the rate structure in this or any other tariff bill is perfect , but i am convinced that the disposal of the whole question is urgent .
i believe that the flexible provisions can within reasonable time remedy inequalities ; that this provision is a progressive advance and gives great hope of taking the tariff away from politics , lobbying , and log rolling ; that the bill gives protection to agriculture for the market of its products and to several industries in need of such protection for the wage of their labor ; that with returning normal conditions our foreign trade will continue to expand .

this campaign is more than a contest between two men .
it is more than a contest between two parties .
it is a contest between two philosophies of government .
we are told by the opposition that we must have a change , that we must have a new deal .
it is not the change that comes from normal development of national life to which i object , but the proposal to alter the whole foundations of our national life which have been builded through generations of testing and struggle , and of the principles upon which we have builded the nation .
the expressions our opponents use must refer to important changes in our economic and social system and our system of government , otherwise they are nothing but vacuous words .
and i realize that in this time of distress many of our people are asking whether our social and economic system is incapable of that great primary function of providing security and comfort of life to all of the firesides of our 25,000,000 homes in america , whether our social system provides for the fundamental development and progress of our people , whether our form of government is capable of originating and sustaining that security and progress .
this question is the basis upon which our opponents are appealing to the people in their fears and distress .
they are proposing changes and so - called new deals , which would destroy the very foundations of our american system .
our people should consider the primary facts before they come to the judgment -- not merely through political agitation , the glitter of promise , and the discouragement of temporary hardships -- whether they will support changes , which radically affect the whole system , which has been builded up by a hundred and fifty years of the toil of the fathers .
they should not approach the question in the despair with which our opponents would clothe it .
our economic system has received abnormal shocks during the last three years , which temporarily dislocated its normal functioning .
these shocks have in large sense come from without our borders , but i say to you that our system of government has enabled us to take such strong action as to prevent the disaster , which would otherwise have come to our nation .
it has enabled us further to develop measures and programs , which are now demonstrating their ability to bring about restoration and progress .
we must go deeper than platitudes and emotional appeals of the public platform in the campaign , if we will penetrate to the full significance of the changes , which our opponents are attempting to float upon the wave of distress and discontent from the difficulties we are passing through .
we can find what our opponents would do after searching the record of their appeals to discontent , group and sectional interest .
we must search for them in the legislative acts , which they sponsored and passed in the democratic - controlled house of representatives in the last session of congress .
we must look into measures for which they voted and which were defeated .
we must inquire whether or not the presidential and vice - presidential candidates have disavowed these acts .
if they have not , we must conclude that they form a portion and are a substantial indication of the profound changes proposed .
and we must look still further than this as to what revolutionary changes have been proposed by the candidates themselves .
we must look into the type of leaders who are campaigning for the democratic ticket , whose philosophies have been well known all their lives , whose demands for a change in the american system are frank and forceful .
i can respect the sincerity of these men in their desire to change our form of government and our social and economic system , though i shall do my best tonight to prove they are wrong .
i refer particularly to senator norris , senator lafollette , senator cutting , senator huey long , senator wheeler , william r. hearst , and other exponents of a social philosophy different from the traditional american one .
unless these men feel assurance of support to their ideas they certainly would not be supporting these candidates and the democratic party .
the seal of these men indicates that they have sure confidence that they will have voice in the administration of our government .
i may say at once that the changes proposed from all these democratic principles and allies are of the most profound and penetrating character .
if they are brought about this will not be the american , which we have known in the past .
let us pause for a moment and examine the american system of government , of social and economic life , which it is now proposed that we should alter .
our system is the product of our race and of our experience in building a nation to heights unparalleled in the whole history of the world .
it is a system peculiar to the american people .
it differs essentially from all others in the world .
it is an american system .
it is founded on the conception that only through ordered liberty , through freedom to the individual , and equal opportunity to the individual will his initiative and enterprise be summoned to spur the march of progress .
it is by the maintenance of equality of opportunity and therefore of a society absolutely fluid in freedom of the movement of its human particles that our individualism departs from the individualism of europe .
we resent class distinction because there can be no rise for the individual through the frozen strata of classes and no stratification of classes can take place in a mass livened by the free rise of its particles .
thus in our ideals the able and ambitious are able to rise constantly from the bottom to leadership in the community .
this freedom of the individual creates of itself the necessity and the cheerful willingness of men to act co - operatively in a thousand ways and for every purpose as occasion arises ; and it permits such voluntary co - operations to be dissolved as soon as they have served their purpose , to be replaced by new voluntary associations for new purposes .
there has thus grown within us , to gigantic importance , a new conception .
that is , this voluntary co - operation within the community .
co - operation to perfect the social organizations ; co - operation for the care of those in distress ; co - operation for the advancement of knowledge , of scientific research , of education ; for co - operative action in the advancement of many phases of economic life .
this is self - government by the people outside of government ; it is the most powerful development of individual freedom and equal opportunity that has taken place in the century and a half since our fundamental institutions were founded .
it is in the further development of this co - operation and a sense of its responsibility that we should find solution for many of our complex problems , and not by the extension of government into our economic and social life .
the greatest function of government is to build up that co - operation , and its most resolute action should be to deny the extension of bureaucracy .
we have developed great agencies of co - operation by the assistance of the government , which promote and protect the interests of individuals and the smaller units of business .
the federal reserve system , in its strengthening and support of the smaller banks ; the farm board , in its strengthening and support of the farm co - operatives ; the home loan banks , in the mobilizing of building and loan associations and savings banks ; the federal land banks , in giving independence and strength to land mortgage associations ; the great mobilization of relief to distress , the mobilization of business and industry in measures of recovery , and a score of other activities are not socialism -- they are the essence of protection to the development of free men .
the primary conception of this whole american system is not the regimentation of men but the co - operation of free men .
it is founded upon the conception of responsibility of the individual to the community , of the responsibility of local government to the state , of the state to the national government .
it is founded on a peculiar conception of self - government designed to maintain this equal opportunity to the individual , and through decentralization it brings about and maintains these responsibilities .
the centralization of government will undermine responsibilities and will destroy the system .
our government differs from all previous conceptions , not only in this decentralization , but also in the separation of functions between the legislative , executive , and judicial arms of government , in which the independence of the judicial arm is the keystone of the whole structure .
it is founded on a conception that in times of emergency , when forces are running beyond control of individuals or other co - operative action , beyond the control of local communities and of states , then the great reserve powers of the federal government shall be brought into action to protect the community .
but when these forces have ceased there must be a return of state , local , and individual responsibility .
the implacable march of scientific discovery with its train of new inventions presents every year new problems to government and new problems to the social order .
questions often arise whether , in the face of the growth of these new and gigantic tools , democracy can remain master in its own house , can preserve the fundamentals of our american system .
i contend that it can ; and i contend that this american system of ours has demonstrated its validity and superiority over any system yet invented by human mind .
it has demonstrated it in the face of the greatest test of our history -- that is the emergency , which we have faced in the last three years .
when the political and economic weakness of many nations of europe , the result of the world war and its aftermath , finally culminated in collapse of their institutions , the delicate adjustments of our economic and social life received a shock unparalleled in our history .
no one knows that better than you of new york .
no one knows it causes better than you .
that the crisis was so great that many of the leading banks sought directly or indirectly to convert their assets into gold or its equivalent with the result that they practically ceased to function as credit institutions ; that many of our citizens sought flight for their capital to other countries ; that many of them attempted to hoard gold in large amounts .
these were but indications of the flight of confidence and of the belief that our government could not overcome these forces .
yet these forces were overcome -- perhaps by narrow margins -- and this action demonstrates what the courage of a nation can accomplish under the resolute leadership in the republican party .
and i say the republican party because our opponents , before and during the crisis , proposed no constructive program ; though some of their members patriotically supported ours .
later on the democratic house of representatives did develop the real thought and ideas of the democratic party , but it was so destructive that it had to be defeated , for it would have destroyed , not healed .
in spite of all these obstructions we did succeed .
our form of government did prove itself equal to the task .
we saved this nation from a quarter of a century of chaos and degeneration , and we preserved the savings , the insurance policies , gave a fighting chance to men to hold their homes .
we saved the integrity of our government and the honesty of the american dollar .
and we installed measures , which today are bringing back recovery .
employment , agriculture , business -- all of these show the steady , if slow , healing of our enormous wound .
i therefore contend that the problem of today is to continue these measures and policies to restore this american system to its normal functioning , to repair the wounds it has received , to correct the weaknesses and evils , which would defeat that system .
to enter upon a series of deep changes to embark upon this inchoate new deal , which has been propounded in this campaign , would be to undermine and destroy our american system .
before we enter upon such courses , i would like you to consider what the results of this american system have been during the last thirty years -- that is , one single generation .
for if it can be demonstrated that by means of this , our unequalled political , social , and economic system , we have secured a lift in the standards of living and a diffusion of comfort and hope to men and women , the growth of equal opportunity , the widening of all opportunity , such as had never been seen in the history of the world , then we should not tamper with it or destroy it ; but on the contrary we should restore it and , by its gradual improvement and perfection , foster it into new performance for our country and for our children .
now , if we look back over the last generation we find that the number of our families and , therefore , our homes , has increased from sixteen to twenty - five million , or 62 per cent .
in that time we have builded for them 15,000,000 new and better homes .
we have equipped 20,000,000 homes with electricity ; thereby we have lifted infinite drudgery from women and men .
the barriers of time and space have been swept away .
life has been made freer ; the intellectual vision of every individual has been expanded by the installation of 20,000,000 telephones , 12,000,000 radios , and the service of 20,000,000 automobiles .
our cities have been made magnificent with beautiful buildings , parks , and playgrounds .
our countryside has been knit together with splendid roads .
we have increased by twelve times the use of electrical power and thereby taken sweat from the backs of men .
in this broad sweep real wages and purchasing power of men and women have steadily increased .
new comforts have steadily come to them .
the hours of labor have decreased , the 12-hour day has disappeared , even the 9-hour day has almost gone .
we are now advancing the 5-day week .
the portals of opportunity to our children have ever widened .
while our population grew by but 62 per cent , we have increased the number of children in high schools by 700 per cent , those in institutions of higher learning by 300 per cent .
with all our spending , we multiplied by six times the savings in our banks and in our building and loan associations .
we multiplied by 1,200 per cent the amount of our life insurance .
with the enlargement of our leisure we have come to a fuller life ; we gained new visions of hope , we more nearly realize our national aspiration and give increasing scope to the creative power of every individual and expansion of every man 's mind .
our people in these thirty years grew in the sense of social responsibility .
there is profound progress in the relation of the employer and employed .
we have more nearly met with a full hand the most sacred obligation of man , that is , the responsibility of a man to his neighbor .
support to our schools , hospitals , and institutions for the care of the afflicted surpassed in totals of billions the proportionate service in any period of history in any nation in the world .
three years ago there came a break in this progress .
a break of the same type we have met fifteen times a century and yet we have overcome them .
but eighteen months later came a further blow by shocks transmitted to us by the earthquakes of the collapse in nations throughout the world as the aftermath of the world war .
the workings of our system were dislocated .
millions of men and women are out of jobs .
businessmen and farmers suffer .
their distress is bitter .
i do not seek to minimize the depth of it .
we may thank god that in view of this storm 30,000,000 still have their jobs ; yet this must not distract our thoughts from the suffering of the other 10,000,000 .
but i ask you what has happened .
these thirty years of incomparable improvement in the scale of living , the advance of comfort and intellectual life , inspiration and ideals did not arise without right principles animating the american system , which produced them .
shall that system be discarded because vote - seeking men appeal to distress and say that the machinery is all wrong and that it must be abandoned or tampered with ?
is it not more sensible to realize the simple fact that some extraordinary force has been thrown into the mechanism , temporarily deranging its operation ?
is it not wiser to believe that the difficulty is not with the principles upon which our american system is founded and designed through all these generations of inheritance ?
should not our purpose be to restore the normal working of that system which has brought to us such immeasurable benefits , and not destroy it ?
and in order to indicate to you that the proposals of our opponents will endanger or destroy our system , i propose to analyze a few of the proposals of our opponents in the relation to these fundamentals .
first : a proposal of our opponents , which would break down the american system , is the expansion of government expenditure by yielding to sectional and group raids on the public treasury .
the extension of government expenditures beyond the minimum limit necessary to conduct the proper functions of the government enslaves men to work for the government .
if we combine the whole governmental expenditures -- national , state , and municipal -- we will find that before the world way each citizen worked , theoretically , twenty - five days out of each year for the government .
today he works for the support of all forms of government sixty - one days out of the year .
no nation can conscript its citizens for this proportion of men 's time without national impoverishment and destruction of their liberties .
our nation can not do it without destruction to our whole conception of the american system .
the federal government has been forced in this emergency to unusual expenditure , but in partial alleviation of these extraordinary and unusual expenditures the republican administration has made a successful effort to reduce the ordinary running expenses of the government .
our opponents have persistently interfered with such policies .
i only need recall to you that the democratic house of representatives passed bills in the last session that would have increased our expenditures by $ 3,500,000,000 , or 87 per cent .
expressed in days ' labor , this would have meant the conscription of sixteen days ' additional work from every citizen for the government .
this i stopped .
furthermore , they refused to accept recommendations from the administration in respect to $ 150,000,000 to $ 200,000,000 of reductions in ordinary expenditures , and finally they forced upon us increasing expenditure of $ 322,000,000 .
in spite of this , the ordinary expenses of the government have been reduced upwards of $ 200,000,000 during this present administration .
they will be decidedly further reduced .
but the major point i wish to make -- the disheartening part of these proposals of our opponents -- is that they represent successful pressures of minorities .
they would appeal to sectional and group political support and thereby impose terrific burdens upon every home in the country .
these things can and must be resisted .
but they can only be resisted if there shall be live and virile public support to the administration , in opposition to political log - rolling and the sectional and group raids on the treasury for distribution of public money , which is cardinal in the congeries of elements which make up the democratic party .
these expenditures proposed by the democratic house of representatives for the benefit of special groups and special sections of our country directly undermine the american system .
those who pay are , in the last analysis , the man who works at the bench , the desk , and on the farm .
they take away his comfort , stifle his leisure , and destroy his equal opportunity .
second : another proposal of our opponents , which would destroy the american system , is that of inflation of the currency .
the bill , which passed the last session of the democratic house , called upon the treasure of the united states to issue $ 2,300,000,000 in paper currency that would be unconvertible into solid values .
call it what you will , greenbacks or fiat money .
it was that nightmare which overhung our own country for years after the civil war . . . .
third : in the last session the congress , under the personal leadership of the democratic vice - presidential candidate , and their allies in the senate , enacted a law to extend the government into personal banking business .
this i was compelled to veto , out of fidelity to the whole american system of life and government . . . .
fourth : another proposal of our opponents , which would wholly alter our american system of life , is to reduce the protective tariff to a competitive tariff for revenue .
the protective tariff and its results upon our economic structure has become gradually embedded into our economic life since the first protective tariff act passed by the american congress under the administration of george washington .
there have been gaps at times of democratic control when this protection has been taken away .
but it has been so embedded that its removal has never failed to bring disaster . . . .
fifth : another proposal is that the government go into the power business .
three years ago , in view of the extension of the use of transmission of power over state borders and the difficulties of state regulatory bodies in the face of this interstate action , i recommended to the congress that such interstate power should be placed under regulation by the federal government in co - operation with the state authorities .
that recommendation was in accord with the principles of the republican party over the last fifty years , to provide regulation where public interest had developed in tools of industry , which was beyond control , and regulation of the states .
i succeeded in creating an independent power commission to handle such matters , but the democratic house declined to approve the further powers to this commission necessary for such regulation .
i have stated unceasingly that i am opposed to the federal government going into the power business .
i have insisted upon rigid regulation .
the democratic candidate has declared that under the same conditions , which may make local action of this character desirable , he is prepared to put the federal government into the power business .
he is being actively supported by a score of senators in this campaign , many of whose expenses are being paid by the democratic national committee , who are pledged to federal government development and operation of electrical power .
i find in the instructions to campaign speakers issued by the democratic national committee that they are instructed to criticize my action in the veto of the bill , which would have put the government permanently into the operation of power at muscle shoals with a capital from the federal treasury of over $ 100,000,000 .
in fact thirty - one democratic senators , being all except three , voted to override that veto .
in that bill was the flat issue of the federal government permanently in competitive business .
i vetoed it because of principle and not because it was especially the power business .
in the veto i stated that i was firmly opposed to the federal government entering into any business , the major purpose of which is competition with our citizens .
i said : 
 there are national emergencies which require that the government should temporarily enter the field of business but that they must be emergency actions and in matters where the cost of the project is secondary to much higher consideration .
there are many localities where the federal government is justified in the construction of great dams and reservoirs , where navigation , flood control , reclamation , or stream regulation are of dominant importance , and where they are beyond the capacity or purpose of private or local government capital to construct .
in these cases , power is often a by - product and should be disposed of by contract or lease .
but for the federal government to deliberately go out to build up and expand such an occasion to the major purpose of a power and manufacturing business is to break down the initiative and enterprise of the american people ; it is destruction of equality of opportunity among our people ; it is the negation of the ideals upon which our civilization has been based .
this bill raises one of the important issues confronting our people .
that is squarely the issue of federal government ownership and operation of power and manufacturing business not as a minor by - product but as a major purpose .
involved in this question is the agitation against the conduct of the power industry .
the power problem is not to be solved by the federal government going into the power business , nor is it to be solved by the project in this bill .
the remedy for abuses in the conduct of that industry lies in regulation and not by the federal government entering upon the business itself .
i have recommended to the congress on various occasions that action should be taken to establish federal regulation of interstate power in co - operation with state authorities .
this bill would launch the federal government upon a policy of ownership of power utilities upon a basis of competition instead of by the proper government function of regulation for the protection of all the people .
i hesitate to contemplate the future of our institutions , of our government , and of or country , if the preoccupation of its officials is to be no longer the promotion of justice and equal opportunity but is to be devoted to barter in the markets .
that is not liberalism ; it is degeneration .
from their utterances in this campaign and elsewhere we 're justified in the conclusion that our opponents propose to put the federal government in the power business with all its additions to federal bureaucracy , its tyranny over state and local governments , its undermining of state and local responsibilities and initiative .
sixth : i may cite another instance of absolutely destructive proposals to our american system by our opponents .
recently there was circulated through the unemployed in this country a letter from the democratic candidate in which he stated that he 
 . . .
would support measures for the inauguration of self - liquidating public works such as the utilization of water resources , flood control , land reclamation , to provide employment for all surplus labor at all times .
i especially emphasize that promise to promote " employment for all surplus labor at all times . "
at first i could not believe that any one would be so cruel as to hold out a hope so absolutely impossible of realization to those 10,000,000 who are unemployed .
but the authenticity of this promise has been verified .
and i protest against such frivolous promises being held out to a suffering people .
it is easily demonstrable that no such employment can be found .
but the point i wish to make here and now is the mental attitude and spirit of the democratic party to attempt it .
it is another mark of the character of the new deal and the destructive changes which mean the total abandonment of every principle upon which this government and the american system are founded .
if it were possible to give this employment to 10,000,000 people by the government , it would cost upwards of $ 9,000,000,00 a year . . . .
i have said before , and i want to repeat on this occasion , that the only method by which we can stop the suffering and unemployment is by returning our people to their normal jobs in their normal homes , carrying on their normal functions of living .
this can be done only by sound processes of protecting and stimulating recovery of the existing economic system upon which we have builded our progress thus far -- preventing distress and giving such sound employment as we can find in the meantime .
seventh : recently , at indianapolis , i called attention to the statement made by governor roosevelt in his address on october 25th with respect to the supreme court of the united states .
he said : 
 after march 4 , 1929 , the republican party was in complete control of all branches of the government -- executive , senate , and house , and i may add , for good measure , in order to make it complete , the supreme court as well .
i am not called upon to defend the supreme court of the united states from this slurring reflection .
fortunately that court has jealously maintained over the years its high standard of integrity , impartiality , and freedom from influence of either the executive or congress , so that the confidence of the people is sound and unshaken .
but is the democratic candidate really proposing his conception of the relation of the executive and the supreme court ?
if that is his idea , he is proposing the most revolutionary new deal , the most stupendous breaking of precedent , the most destructive undermining of the very safeguard of our form of government yet proposed by a presidential candidate .
eighth : in order that we may get at the philosophical background of the mind , which pronounces the necessity for profound change in our american system and a new deal , i would call your attention to an address delivered by the democratic candidate in san francisco , early in october .
he said : 
 our industrial plant is built .
the problem just now is whether under existing conditions it is not overbuilt .
our last frontier has long since been reached .
there is practically no more free land .
there is no safety valve in the western prairies where we can go for a new start . . . .
the mere building of more industrial plants , the organization of more corporations is as likely to be as much a danger as a help . . . .
our task now is not the discovery of natural resources or necessarily the production of more goods , it is the sober , less dramatic business of administering the resources and plants already in hand . . .
establishing markets for surplus production , of meeting the problem of under - consumption , distributing the wealth and products more equitably and adapting the economic organization to the service of the people . . . .
there are many of these expressions with which no one would quarrel .
but i do challenge the whole idea that we have ended the advance of america , that this country has reached the zenith of its power , the height of its development .
that is the counsel of despair for the future of america .
that is not the spirit by which we shall emerge from this depression .
that is not the spirit that made this country .
if it is true , every american must abandon the road of countless progress and unlimited opportunity .
i deny that the promise of american life has been fulfilled , for that means we have begun the decline and fall .
no nation can cease to move forward without degeneration of spirit . . . .
if these measures , these promises , which i have discussed ; or these failures to disavow these projects ; this attitude of mind , mean anything , they mean the enormous expansion of the federal government ; they mean the growth of bureaucracy such as we have never seen in our history .
no man who has not occupied my position in washington can fully realize the constant battle which must be carried on against incompetence , corruption , tyranny of government expanded into business activities .
if we first examine the effect on our form of government of such a program , we come at once to the effect of the most gigantic increase in expenditure ever known in history .
that alone would break down the savings , the wages , the equality of opportunity among our people .
these measures would transfer vast responsibilities to the federal government from the states , the local governments , and the individuals .
but that is not all ; they would break down our form of government .
our legislative bodies can not delegate their authority to any dictator , but without such delegation every member of these bodies is impelled in representation of the interest of his constituents constantly to seek privilege and demand service in the use of such agencies .
every time the federal government extends its arm , 531 senators and congressmen become actual boards of directors of that business .
capable men can not be chosen by politics for all the various talents required .
even if they were supermen , if there were no politics in the selection of the congress , if there were no constant pressure for this and for that , so large a number would be incapable as a board of directors of any institution .
at once when these extensions take place by the federal government , the authority and responsibility of state governments and institutions are undermined .
every enterprise of private business is at once halted to know what federal action is going to be .
it destroys initiative and courage .
we can do no better than quote that great statesman of labor , the late samuel gompers , in speaking of a similar situation : 
 it is a question of whether it shall be government ownership or private ownership under control .
if i were a minority of one in this convention , i would want to cast my vote so that the men of labor shall not willingly enslave themselves to government in their industrial effort .
we have heard a great deal in this campaign about reactionaries , conservatives , progressives , liberals , and radicals .
i have not yet heard an attempt by any one of the orators who mouth these phrases to define the principles upon which they base these classifications .
there is one thing i can say without any question of doubt -- that it , that the spirit of liberalism is to create free men ; it is not the regimentation of men .
it is not the extension of bureaucracy .
i have said in this city before now that you can not extend the mastery of government over the daily life of a people without somewhere making it master of people 's souls and thoughts .
expansion of government in business means that the government , in order to protect itself from the political consequences of its errors , is driven irresistibly without peace to greater and greater control of the nation 's press and platform .
free speech does not live many hours after free industry and free commerce die .
it is a false liberalism that interprets itself into government operation of business .
every step in that direction poisons the very roots of liberalism .
it poisons political equality , free speech , free press , and equality of opportunity .
it is the road not to liberty but to less liberty .
true liberalism is found not i striving to spread bureaucracy , but in striving to set bounds to it .
true liberalism seeks all legitimate freedom first in the confident belief that without such freedom the pursuit of other blessings is in vain .
liberalism is a force truly of the spirit proceeding from the deep realization that economic freedom can not be sacrificed if political freedom is to be preserved .
even if the government conduct of business could give us the maximum of efficiency instead of least efficiency , it would be purchased at the cost of freedom .
it would increase rather than decrease abuse and corruption , stifle initiative and invention , undermine development of leadership , cripple mental and spiritual energies of our people , extinguish equality of opportunity , and dry up the spirit of liberty and progress .
men who are going about this country announcing that they are liberals because of their promises to extend the government in business are not liberals ; they are reactionaries of the united states .
and i do not wish to be misquoted or misunderstood .
i do not mean that our government is to part with one iota of its national resources without complete protection to the public interest .
i have already stated that democracy must remain master in its own house .
i have stated that abuse and wrongdoing must be punished and controlled .
nor do i wish to be misinterpreted as stating that the united states is a free - for - all and devil -- take - the - hindermost society .
the very essence of equality of opportunity of our american system is that there shall be no monopoly or domination by any group or section in this country , whether it be business , sectional , or a group interest .
on the contrary , our american system demands economic justice as well as political and social justice ; it is not a system of laissez faire .
i am not setting up the contention that our american system is perfect .
no human ideal has ever been perfectly attained , since humanity itself is not perfect .
but the wisdom of our forefathers and the wisdom of the thirty men who have preceded me in this office hold to the conception that progress can be attained only as the sum of accomplishments of free individuals , and they have held unalterably to these principles .
in the ebb and flow of economic life our people in times of prosperity and ease naturally tend to neglect the vigilance over their rights .
moreover , wrongdoing is obscured by apparent success in enterprise .
then insidious diseases and wrongdoings grow apace .
but we have in the past seen in times of distress and difficulty that wrongdoing and weakness come to the surface , and our people , in their endeavors to correct these wrongs , are tempted to extremes which may destroy rather than build .
it is men who do wrong , not our institutions .
it is men who violate the laws and public rights .
it is men , not institutions , who must be punished .
in my acceptance speech four years ago at palo alto i stated that -- 
 one of the oldest aspirations of the human race was the abolition of poverty .
by poverty i mean the grinding by under - nourishment , cold , ignorance , fear of old age to those who have the will to work .
i stated that -- 
 in america today we are nearer a final triumph over poverty than in any land .
the poorhouse has vanished from among us ; we have not reached that goal , but given a chance to go forward , we shall , with the help of god , be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation .
my countrymen , the proposals of our opponents represent a profound change in american life -- less in concrete proposal , bad as that may be , than by implication and by evasion .
dominantly in their spirit they represent a radical departure from the foundations of 150 years , which have made this the greatest nation in the world .
this election is not a mere shift from the ins to the outs .
it means deciding the direction our nation will take over a century to come .
my conception of america is a land where men and women may walk in ordered liberty , where they may enjoy the advantages of wealth not concentrated in the hands of a few but diffused through the lives of all , where they build and safeguard their homes , give to their children full opportunities of american life , where every man shall be respected in the faith that his conscience and his heart direct him to follow , where people secure in their liberty shall have leisure and impulse to seek a fuller life .
that leads to the release of the energies of men and women , to the wider vision and higher hope ; it leads to opportunity for greater and greater service not alone of man to man in our country but from our country to the world .
it leads to health in body and a spirit unfettered , youthful , eager with a vision stretching beyond the farthest horizons will an open mind , sympathetic and generous .
but that must be builded upon our experience with the past , upon the foundations , which have made our country great .
it must be the product of our truly american system .

to the senate : 
 in requesting the senate to convene in session for the special purpose of dealing with the treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armament signed at london april 22 , 1930 , it is desirable that i should present my views upon it .
this is especially necessary because of misinformation and misrepresentation which has been widespread by those who in reality are opposed to all limitation and reduction in naval arms .
we must naturally expect oppositions from those groups who believe in unrestricted military strength as an objective of the american nation .
indeed , we find the same type of minds in great britain and japan in parallel opposition to this treaty .
nevertheless , i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of the american people are opposed to the conception of these groups .
our people believe that military strength should be held in conformity with the sole purpose of national defense ; they earnestly desire real progress in limitation and reduction of naval arms of the world , and their aspiration is for abolition of competition in the building of arms as a step toward world peace .
such a result can be obtained in no other way than by international agreement .
the present treaty is one which holds these safeguards and advances these ideals .
its ratification is in the interest of the united states .
it is fair to the other participating nations .
it promotes the cause of good relations .
the only alternative to this treaty is the competitive building of navies with all its flow of suspicion , hate , ill will , and ultimate disaster .
history supports those who hold to agreement as the path to peace .
every naval limitation treaty with which we are familiar , from the rush - bagot agreement of 1817 , limiting vessels of war on the great lakes , to the washington arms treaty of 1921 , has resulted in a marked growth of good will and confidence between the nations which were parties to it .
it is folly to think that because we are the richest nation in the world we can out build all other countries .
other nations will make any sacrifice to maintain their instruments of defense against us , and we shall eventually reap in their hostility and ill will the full measure of the additional burden which we may thus impose upon them .
the very entry of the united states into such courses as this would invite the consolidation of the rest of the world against us and bring our peace and independence into jeopardy .
we have only to look at the state of europe in 1914 to find ample evidence of the futility and danger of competition in arms .
it will be remembered that in response to recommendations from the senate a conference between the united states , great britain , and japan , for limitation of those categories of naval arms not covered by the washington treaty of 1921 was held at geneva in 1927 .
that conference failed because the united states could not agree to the large size of fleets demanded by other governments .
the standards set up at that time would have required an ultimate fleet of about 1,400,000 tons for the united states .
as against this the total united states fleet set out under this treaty will be about 1,123,000 tons .
defense is the primary function of government , and therefore our first concern in examination of any act of this character is the test of its adequacy in defense .
no critic has yet asserted that with the navies provided in this agreement , together with our army , our aerial defense , and our national resources , we can not defend ourselves ; and certainly we want no military establishment for the purpose of domination of other nations .
our naval - defense position under this treaty is the more clear if we examine our present naval strength in comparison to the present strength of the other nations , and then examine the improvements in this proportion which will result from this treaty .
this improvement arises from the anticipation of parity in battleships to be reached 10 years hence under the washington arms treaty and the fact that other nations have been building in the classes of ships not limited by that treaty , while we , until lately , lagged behind .
on the 1st of january last the total naval tonnage , disregarding paper fleets , and taking only those ships actually built and building , was , for the united states 1,180,000 tons ; for the british empire 1,332,000 tons ; for japan 768,000 tons .
that is , if the united states navy be taken as 100 , then the british navy equals 113 and the japanese navy 65 .
under this treaty the united states will have 1,123,000 tons , great britain 1,151,000 tons , and japan 714,000 tons , or a ratio of 100 for the united states to 102.4 for great britain and 63.6 for japan .
the slightly larger tonnage ratio mentioned for great britain is due to the fact that her cruiser fleet will be constituted more largely of smaller vessels , weaker in gun power , but the united states has the option to duplicate the exact tonnage and gun caliber of the british cruiser fleet if we desire to exercise it 
 the relative improvement in the position of the united states under this treaty is even better than this statement would indicate .
in the more important categories -- battleships , aircraft carriers , 8-inch and 6-inch cruisers , that is , omitting the secondary arms of destroyers and submarines -- the fleet built and actually building on january 1 , of this year was 809,000 tons in the united states , 1,088,000 tons in great britain and 568,000 tons in japan , or upon the basis of 100 for the united states it was 134 for great britain and 70 for japan .
under this treaty the united states will on january 1 , 1937 , possess , completed , 911,000 tons of these major units , great britain 948,000 tons and japan 556,000 tons .
in addition , the united states will have one 10,000-ton 8-inch cruiser two - thirds completed .
this will give a ratio in these categories of 100 for the united states to 102.9 for great britain and 60.5 for japan .
the reason for the excess british tonnage is again as mentioned above .
in other words , the united states , in these categories , increases by 102,000 tons , great britain decreases by 140,000 tons and japan decreases by 12,000 tons .
these readjustments of units are to take place during the next six years .
the treaty then comes to an end except for such arrangements as may be made then for its continuance .
the major discussion has been directed almost wholly to the fact that the united states is to have 18 cruisers armed with 8-inch guns , with an aggregate tonnage of 180,000 tons , as against great britain 's 15 such ships , with a tonnage of 146,800 tons and japan 's 12 such ships of a tonnage of 108,400 tons ; the united states supplementing this tonnage with cruisers armed with 6-inch guns up to a total of 323,500 tons , great britain up to 339,000 tons , and japan to 208,800 tons ; the larger gross tonnage to great britain , as stated , being compensation for the larger gun caliber of the american cruiser fleet ; but , as said , the united states has the option to duplicate the british fleet , if it so desires .
criticism of this arrangement arises from the fact that the general board of the united states navy recommended that to reach parity with great britain the united states should have three more of the 10,000-ton cruisers ( 21 instead of 18 ) , with 8-inch guns , and a total of 315,000 tons or 8,000 tons less total cruiser tonnage than this treaty provides .
thus this treaty provides that instead of this 30,000 tons more of 8-inch ships recommended by the general board , we will have 38,000 tons of ships armed with 6-inch guns , there being no limitation upon the size of cruisers up to 10,000 tons .
therefore , criticism revolves around less than 3 per cent of our whole fleet , and even within this 3 per cent comes the lesser question of whether 30,000 tons of ships armed with 8-inch guns are better than 38,000 tons armed with 6-inch guns .
the opinion of our high naval authorities is divided on the relative merits of these alternatives .
many earnestly believe that the larger tonnage of 6-inch ships is more advantageous and others vice versa .
however , those who seek to make this the outstanding feature of criticism fail to mention that under the london treaty the obligation of the washington arms treaty of 1921 is so altered that great britain scraps 133,900 tons of battleships armed with 13&#1029;-inch guns , the united states scraps 70,000 tons of battleships armed with 12-inch guns , and japan scraps 26,300 tons .
these arrangements are made not only for reduction of arms but to anticipate the ultimate parity between the united states and great britain in battleships which would not otherwise be realized for several years .
there is in this provision a relative gain in proportions compared with the british fleet of 63,900 tons of battleships with 13 1/2-inch guns .
this is of vastly more importance than the dispute as to the relative combatant strength of 38,000 tons of 6-inch cruisers against 30,000 tons of 8-inch cruisers .
indeed it would seem that such criticisms must be based upon an undisclosed desire to break down all limitation of arms .
to those who seek earnestly and properly for reduction in warships , i would point out that as compared with january 1 of this year , the total aggregate navies of the three powers under this treaty will have been reduced by nearly 300,000 tons .
had a settlement been made at geneva in 1927 upon the only proposal possible at that time , the fleets of the three powers would have been approximately 680,000 tons greater than under the treaty now in consideration .
the economic burdens and the diversion of taxes from welfare purposes which would be imposed upon ourselves and other nations by failure of this treaty are worth consideration .
under its provisions the replacement of battleships required under the washington arms treaty of 1921 is postponed for six years .
the costs of replacing and maintaining the three scrapped battleships is saved .
likewise we make economies in construction and operation by the reduction in our submarine and destroyer fleets to 52,700 and 150,000 tons respectively .
what the possible saving over an otherwise inevitable era of competitive building would be no one can estimate .
if we assume that our present naval program , except for this treaty , is to complete the ships authorized by congress and those authorized and necessary to be replaced under the washington arms treaty , and to maintain a destroyer fleet of about 225,000 tons and a submarine fleet of 90,000 tons , such a fleet will not reach parity with great britain , yet would cost in construction over $ 500,000,000 more during the next six years than the fleet provided under this treaty .
but in addition to this , as stated , there is a very large saving by this treaty in annual operation of the fleet over what would be the case if we even built no more than the present programs .
the more selfish minded will give little credence to the argument that savings by other parties to the agreement in the limitation of naval construction are of interest to the american people , yet the fundamental economic fact is that if the resources of these other nations are freed for devotion to the welfare of their people and to pacific purposes of reproductive commerce , they will result in blessings to the world , including ourselves .
if we were to accept the geneva conference base as the end of naval strength under competitive building for the three governments , the savings in construction and operation by the treaty is literally billions of dollars .
the question before us now is not whether we shall have a treaty with either three more 8-inch cruisers or four less 6-inch cruisers , or whether we shall have a larger reduction in tonnage .
it is whether we shall have this treaty or no treaty .
it is a question as to whether we shall move strongly toward limitation and reduction in naval arms or whether we shall have no limitation or reduction and shall enter upon a disastrous period of competitive armament .
this treaty does mark an important step in disarmament and in world peace .
it is important for many reasons that it should be dealt with at once .
the subject has been under discussion since the geneva conference three years ago .
the lines of this treaty have been known and under discussion since last summer .
the actual document has been before the american people and before the senate for nearly three months .
it has been favorably reported by the senate foreign relations committee .
every solitary fact which affects judgment upon the treaty is known , and the document itself comprises the sole obligation of the united states .
if we fail now , the world will be again plunged backward from its progress toward peace .

in these closing hours of the campaign i am conscious that the american people are summing up in their minds the candidates ' statements , the issues , weighing the expositions of party policy , making their appraisals of party measures and of men , and thus preparing themselves individually for their final personal decision to be expressed by their ballots at the polls next tuesday .
i stated a few days ago that the most important issue before the american people at this moment is to overcome this crisis .
what our people need is the restoration of their normal jobs and the recovery of agricultural prices and of business .
they need help in the meantime to tide them over their difficulties in order that they may not suffer privation or lose their farms and homes .
there are other measures which concern the more distant future .
we must not lose sight of them .
but the great balance in which to weigh the two great political parties today is in their attitude toward this immediate problem , because in this attitude lies their philosophy of government , their ability to penetrate into causes , their capacity to meet emergency and to translate measures into action .
and in these balances should also be weighed the question of honesty in presentation to the people of the facts so that they may formulate a proper judgment .
there is beyond this the common , everyday fact as to whether the present administration measures and policies now in action are accomplishing the purposes for which they were set out and therefore deserve ratification and retention by the people .
there is also revealed in this accomplishment what we may hope for in the way of performance for the future .
many of our hopes for the long - view development of our nation have been interrupted by the necessity to devote our concentrated attention to the protection of the american people from the cataclysm which has swept over the world as the result of the aftermath of the world war .
our opponents have endeavored to build a fantastic fiction as to the causes of these events in the last 3 years in order that they might blame the republican party for all the distress and disasters which have happened , not only in our country but in the rest of the world , and thus resort to the oldest trick of politics by stimulating a protest vote .
that is playing politics with human misery , but in the pursuit of this misrepresentation they have demonstrated a total lack of understanding of the real situation with which the government must deal if we are ever to find our way out of this depression .
this narrowness of vision , this incapacity to reach to the heart of things , is a complete demonstration of their unfitness for the still gigantic task of leading the nation back to normal life and the resumption of its forward march of progress .
they have deliberately avoided and decried the accumulation of strains which grew out of the great war ; they even ignore that such a war took place .
they ignore the piling up of our national debt and the debts among combatant nations greater than the whole wealth of the united states .
they ignore the loss of the productive skill and intelligence of millions in europe , blotted out by battle , disease , and starvation .
they ignore the poison springs of political instability which lay in the treaties that closed the war , the fears and hates that have held armaments to double those before that time .
they ignore the new nationalism of a score of small nations sprung from the war with all their own tariff walls and disturbances to old channels of trade .
they ignore the ruinous government policies which fallaciously sought to build back to prosperity the impoverished countries of europe by enlarged borrowing , by subsidizing industry and employment with taxes that sapped the savings upon which industry must be rejuvenated and commerce solidly built .
under these strains the financial systems of many foreign countries crashed one after another .
these blows struck at us through decreased world consumption of goods .
if we look back over the distress of these years we find that three - quarters of the population of the globe has suffered from the flames of revolution ; many nations were subject to constant change and vacillation ; others resorted to dictatorships and tyranny in desperate attempts to maintain some sort of social order .
i ask you to compare that with the condition of the united states .
we are part of a world , the disturbance of whose remotest population affects our own financial system , our markets , our employment , and the prices of our farm products .
and we have many problems of our own growing out of the great war -- the inflation of values during the war and the stupendous increase of our debt , the failure of foreign countries to respond to their debt obligations to us .
finally , with the desperate crisis abroad , the whole world scrambled to convert their property into gold and thus withdrew from us suddenly over $ 2,400 million of exchange and gold .
these fears spreading to our own citizens caused them to withdraw $ 1,600 million in currency from circulation .
the effect of this was to withdraw vast sums of gold from our own use , as we must protect the gold convertibility of our currency , with further repercussions of credit stringency , unemployment , and dropping prices .
yet we have protected our dollar and made it ring true on every counter in the world .
our own economists overlooked one great fundamental factor -- that while our own people consume 90 percent of their production , yet no one calculated the effect of worldwide fear upon our credit system and on the confidence of the nation which thereby suddenly undermined our industry and commerce .
in the face of these gigantic , appalling worldwide forces our opponents set up the hawley - smoot tariff bill -- changing as it did the tariffs on less than one - sixth of our own imports , one one - hundredth of the world 's imports , and introduced long after the collapse started - as the cause of all this world catastrophe .
what an unspeakable travesty upon reason this explanation is !
suppose that we had never had the hawley - smoot tariff bill .
do you think for one moment that this crushing collapse in the structure of the world , these revolutions , these perils to civilization would not have happened and would not have reached into the united states ?
and yet , in order to make a political campaign by which they can play upon discontent so that they could hope to create a protest vote , they are compelled to set up this travesty of argument .
by this class appeal to the negative impulses of men they endeavor to lead them away from discussion of the actual measures which have been taken to meet the actual facts of the world situation , and to follow a mirage of miscellaneous vague hopes .
they seek to lead them away from their realization that the restoration now begun should not be interrupted .
i would recall to you the unprecedented measures which we have introduced by which we have brought the full reserve powers of the federal government into action to save community values and protect every family and fireside so far as it was humanly possible from deterioration .
we have proved time and again in our history in actual war the altruism and patriotism of our people , the solidarity of their action toward a common objective .
but in this war against the invisible forces , we have seen groups of men attempting to profiteer from the miseries of our people , both to increase their own fortunes and to increase their political strength .
we have seen the very measures we have taken for defense of our people and reconstruction of recovery subjected to the cheapest of political misrepresentation .
we have seen attempts of these same groups even in this national emergency to bring forth a philosophy of government which would destroy the whole american system on which we have builded the greatest nation of a century and a half .
indeed , this is the same philosophy of government which has poisoned all europe .
they have been the fumes of the witch 's caldron which boiled in russia and in its attenuated flavor spread over half of europe , and would by many be introduced into the united states in an attempt to secure votes through protest of discontent against emergency conditions .
we have had to meet such handicaps from our opponents both while meeting the first emergency which endangered the nation and in the building of employment and agriculture .
i have enumerated at various times in this campaign the measures adopted by the republican administration to meet this emergency .
i have enumerated on several occasions our long - view policies to cement that recovery and to stimulate progress in our country for the future .
i will take your time for just a moment to refresh your minds on the unprecedented measures adopted from the beginning of this depression .
i will also refresh your minds on the measures , lack of measures , or destructive measures proposed by our opponents .
1 .
the first of our measures , which subsequently proved of great emergency service , was the revision of the tariff .
by this act we gave protection to our agriculture from a world demoralization which would have been infinitely worse than anything we have suffered , and we prevented unemployment of millions of workmen .
2 .
we have secured extension of authority to the tariff commission by which the adjustments can be made to correct inequities in the tariff , and to make changes to meet economic tides and emergencies , thereby avoiding the national disturbance of general revision of the tariff with all its greed and logrolling .
that authority becomes of vital importance today in the face of depreciated currencies abroad .
3 .
at the outset of the depression we brought about an understanding between employers and employees that wages should be maintained .
they were maintained until the cost of living had decreased and the profits had practically vanished .
they are now the highest real wages in the world .
with the concurrent agreement of labor leaders at that time to minimize strikes , we have had a degree of social stability hitherto unknown in the history of any depression in our country .
we have not once in this depression had federal troops under arms to quell conflicts which is the first time in 15 depressions over a century .
i can not pay too high a tribute to the leaders of labor , leaders of industry , and our people in general , for their intelligent self - control and their devotion to the cause of order in time of stress .
last night one of the eminent orators of the democratic party began his speech in new york by accusing the republican party of waging a campaign of fear , declaring that the success of the republican party at the polls next tuesday might be followed by mob disturbances to public order .
how does the gentleman explain the last 3 years of unparalleled social calm ?
does he mean to charge that this magnificent body of self - disciplined citizens is suddenly overnight to become a mob ?
or does he mean to imply that his party is the party of the mob ?
in either event does he mean that we must accept the threat of mob rule in the united states as a guide to our conduct on election day ?
thank god , we still have some officials in washington that can hold out against a mob .
4 .
an agreement to a spread of work where employers were compelled to reduce production was brought about in order that none might be deprived of all their living and all might participate in the existing jobs and thus give real aid to millions of families .
there can be no greater service given by an industry to employees in these times .
5 .
we have mobilized throughout the country private charity and local and state support for the care of distress under which our women and men have given such devoted service that the health of our country has actually improved .
6 .
by the expansion of state , municipal , and private construction work as an aid to employment , and by the development of an enlarged program of federal construction which has been maintained at the rate of $ 600 million a year throughout the depression , we have given support to hundreds of thousands of families .
7 .
by the negotiation of the german moratorium and the standstill agreements upon external debts of that country , we saved their people from a collapse that would have set a prairie fire and possibly have involved the whole of our civilization .
8 .
we created the national credit association by cooperation of the bankers of the country , with a capital of $ 500 million which prevented the failure of a thousand banks with all the tragedies to their depositors and their borrowers .
9 .
by drastic reduction in the ordinary operating expenses of the federal government , together with the increasing of the revenues in the year 1932 , we contributed to balancing the federal budget and thus held impregnable the credit of the united states .
10 .
we created the reconstruction finance corporation , originally with $ 2 billion of resources , in order that , having maintained national credit , we should thrust the full resources of public credit behind private credit of the country and thus reestablish and maintain private enterprise in an unassailable position ; that with this backing of the federal credit , acting through existing institutions , we might protect depositors in savings banks , insurance policyholders , both lenders and borrowers in building and loan associations ; through banking institutions expand the funds available for loans to merchants , manufacturers , farmers , and marketing associations ; that we should protect the railways from receiverships in order that in turn railway securities in the great fiduciary institutions such as our insurance companies and savings banks might be protected and a score of millions saved from distress .
11 .
in addition to strengthening the capital of the federal land banks by $ 125 million we have , through the reconstruction corporation , made large loans to mortgage associations for the same purpose , and lately we have organized all lending agencies into cooperative action to give the farmer who wants to make a fight for his home a chance to hold it from foreclosure .
12 .
we extended authorities under the federal reserve act to protect beyond all question the gold standard of the united states and at the same time expand the credit in counteraction to the strangulation due to hoarding and foreign withdrawals of gold .
13 .
we created the home loan discount banks with direct and indirect resources of several hundred millions , also acting through existing institutions in such fashion as to mobilize the resources of building and loan associations and savings banks and other institutions , furnishing to them cheaper and longer - term capital , to give to them the ability to save homes from foreclosure , to furnish credit to create new homes , and expand employment .
14 .
we secured further authorities to the reconstruction corporation to assist in the earlier liquidation of deposits in closed banks in order that we might relieve distress to millions of depositors .
through democratic opposition we failed to secure authority from congress to carry this on a scale the country so sorely needs today .
15 .
we secured increased authorities to the reconstruction corporation to loan up to $ 300 million to the states whose resources had been exhausted , to enable them to extend full relief to distress , and to prevent any hunger and cold in the united states over this winter .
16 .
we increased the resources to the reconstruction corporation by a further $ 1,500 million for the undertaking of great public works which otherwise would have been delayed awaiting finance , due to the stringency of credit .
these works are of a character which by their own earnings will enable disposal of the repayment of these loans without charge upon the taxpayer .
17 .
we have erected a new system of agricultural credit banks with indirect resources of $ 300 million to reinforce the work of the intermediate credit banks and our other financing institutions in the financing of production and livestock loans to farmers .
any farmer now with sound security may go to them for aid .
18 .
we have extended the authority to the reconstruction corporation to make loans for financing the normal movement of agricultural commodities to markets both at home and abroad .
19 .
we have systematically mobilized banking and industry and business of the country with the cooperation of labor and agricultural leaders to attack the depression on every front .
they have sought out and given assurance of credits to business and industry where employment would be increased , and have cooperated in relief of agricultural mortgage pressures .
20 .
we have developed , together with european nations , a worldwide economic conference with view to relieving pressure upon us from foreign countries , to increase their stability , to deal with the problems of silver , and to prevent recurrence of these calamities if it can be humanly done .
21 .
we have given american leadership in development of drastic reductions of armament in order to reduce our own expenditures by $ 200 million a year and to increase the financial stability of foreign nations and , above all , to relieve the world of fear and political friction .
these are a part -- not all -- of the great and effective weapons with which we have fought the battle that has saved the american people from disaster and chaos .
these weapons are still in action and advancing along the whole front to the restoration of recovery .
i would call your attention to certain economic and social backgrounds of all these instrumentalities , that they are so constructed as to act through existing agencies , to avoid competition of the government with private enterprise and responsibilities .
their essence has been that of cooperation , so created that with the passage of this emergency they can be withdrawn , leaving our economic structure in its full strength and vitality .
they represent the full use of the federal power in time of emergency to protect the people .
that is the reason for the social calm in the united states as contrasted with the riots in nearly every foreign country .
i recently enumerated at detroit some of the evidences of recuperation of the country under these measures in so short a period as 4 months since the destruction of public confidence by the democratic house of representatives ceased .
i do not wish to weary you with statistics , but to show the validity of that progress i may mention that in employment over a million men have now returned to work during these 4 months .
this is the estimate of our government departments .
the estimate of our employers places the number at a million and a half .
certainly we are now gaining a half million a month .
last night i heard an evidence -- an evidence of recuperation that is going on .
the city of st. louis had made application for a large sum from the reconstruction corporation with which to carry their destitute over the winter .
i was informed yesterday that they asked that the application for that loan be cancelled as it was no longer required .
production of boots and shoes amounted to 34 million pairs in october , the highest output for any month in the year and higher than the same month of the previous year .
hoarded currency continues to return ; imports of gold withdrawn by frightened european holders have continued to increase ; deposits of banks continue to show steady expansion .
in 4 months they have increased by nearly a billion dollars .
this is money being put to work and an evidence of renewed confidence .
a further indication of the upward movement of industry lies in the increased demand for electrical power , which has increased by over 8 percent in the last 4 months .
every business index shows some progress somewhere in the nation .
i do not want to say it in criticism , for there is no one more devoted to our form of government than myself , but there is one unfortunate incident in our system , and that is that a change of parties in power at the national election may come at a difficult moment .
a change at this election must mean 4 whole months in which there can be no definition of national policy , during which time not only the commander of the forces in battle for economic recovery must be changed but the subordinate commanders as well .
following the period of delay and uncertainty , the opposition party will , as it has announced , call a special session of congress in order to validate their promises and their new deal .
and whether these new policies be for better or worse , at least a year must elapse before they can emerge into action .
the battle must stagnate at a time of its height , and recovery must inevitably be delayed .
and now in contrast with this constructive program of the republican party and this administration , i wish to develop for you the democratic program to meet this depression as far as we have been able to find any definition to it .
i would again call your attention to the fact that with the democratic victory in congressional elections of 1930 , their leaders promised to produce a program which would redeem this country from the depression .
no such program was produced until we were well into the winter of 1932 .
their program as developed under the leadership of mr. garner by the democratic house of representatives was : 
 1 .
they passed the collier bill , providing for destruction of the tariff commission by reducing it again to a mere statistical body controlled by the congress .
had they succeeded , the relief which you so sorely require from competition with countries of depreciated currencies would today be impossible .
2 .
they attempted to instruct me by legislation to call an international conference through which the aid of foreign nations would be requested to lower american tariffs , by which the independence of the united states in control of its domestic policies was to be placed in the hands of an international body .
3 .
they passed an act instructing me to negotiate reciprocal the result of which could only be to deprive some locality of its protection for the benefit of another , and by which the only sible agreements would involve the reduction of farm tariffs in to build up markets for other goods .
i might further suggest that two largest export commodities in the country are in the hands of a gentleman who will control the next congress .
4 .
they passed an omnibus pension bill with unworthy payments as an indication of their economical temper .
5 .
they passed an inadequate patchwork revenue bill , the injustices of which to different industries and groups must yet be remedied .
6 .
they passed indian claims bills to reopen settlements 75 years old in order to favor certain localities at the expense of the public treasury- 
 7 .
they passed a bill instructing the federal reserve system and the treasury to fix prices at averages prevailing during the years 1921 to 1929 by constantly shifting the volume of currency and credit and thus creation of every uncertainty to business and industry by a rubber dollar .
this bill was stopped , but it has not been removed from their political calendar .
8 .
they defeated a large part of the national economy measure proposed by the administration by their refusal to accept our recommendation , by reduction of ordinary expenditures from $ 250 million to less than $ 50 million , a part of which we subsequently rescued in the senate .
9 .
they passed the garner - rainey pork - barrel bill increasing expenditures by $ 1,200 million for unnecessary nonproductive public works , purely for the benefit of favored localities .
we stopped this bill , but it is still on their political calendar .
10 .
they passed the cash prepayment of the bonus calling for immediate expenditure of $ 2,300 million and for actual increase in liabilities of the federal government over the original act by $ 1,300 million .
we stopped this bill , but it is still on their political calendar .
11 .
they passed the provision for the issuance of over $ 2,200 million of greenback currency , a reversion to vicious practices already demonstrated in the last hundred years as the most destructive to labor , agriculture , and business .
we stopped this bill and even as late as last night the democratic candidate failed to frankly disavow it .
12 .
they passed the rainey bill providing for direct personal banking for every conceivable purpose on every conceivable security to everyone who wants money , and thus the most destructive entry of the government into private business in a fashion that violates every principle of our nation .
i vetoed this bill , but mr. garner still advocates it , and it has not been removed from their political calendar .
13 .
they injected an expenditure of $ 322 million for entirely unnecessary purposes in time of great emergency .
the democratic candidate complains daily that we do not spend this money fast enough .
it is part of his economic program .
14 .
the congress passed proper authority to the executive for reorganization and elimination of useless government commissions and bureaus , but by refusing my recommendations for immediate action they destroyed its usefulness for a long time to come and probably destroyed its consummation .
15 .
the democratic candidate eloquently urges the balancing of the budget , but nowhere disavows these gigantic raids on the treasury , under which no budget can ever be balanced .
thus far i have recounted to you the program of the democratic house under the leadership of mr. garner , whose policies have received commendation from the democratic convention which ratified them by nominating him vice president .
16 .
the democratic candidate adds to this program the proposal to plant a billion trees and thereby immediately employ a million men , but the secretary of agriculture has shown that the trees available to plant will give them a total of less than 3 days ' work .
17 .
the democratic candidate promises to relieve agriculture with a 6-point program which amounts to envisaging to distressed farmers a great structure of agricultural relief , but he has refused to submit it to debate .
he has disclosed no details of the plan except six methods by which he can escape from the promise .
18 .
the candidate has promised the immediate inauguration of a program of self - liquidating public works , such as utilization of our water resources , flood control , and land reclamation , to provide " employment for all surplus labor at all times . "
that is contained in a letter addressed to all the unemployed in the united states which has had enormous circulation .
to employ the whole of the unemployed in the united states would exceed in cost $ 9 billion a year .
these works are unavailable .
if the works were there , the cost would destroy the credit of the government , deprive vast numbers of the men now working of their jobs , and thus destroy the remedy itself .
this fantasy is a cruel promise to these suffering men and women that they will be given jobs by the government which no government could fulfill .
19 .
the democratic party makes its contribution to the emergency by proposing to reduce the tariff to a " competitive tariff for revenue . "
their candidate states that he supports this promise 100 percent .
a competitive tariff today would be ruinous to american agriculture and industry .
these are the only reliefs to this emergency that i can find in the whole democratic program .
they are mostly destructive .
i have given you some of the items of the republican program .
i submit to you this collection of 19 items which have been and are proposed to the american people .
governor roosevelt in his address of last night stated : " i have been scrupulously careful to make no idle promises , to raise no false hopes . "
in st. louis last night , i gave a list of about a dozen unclarified promises , some of which certainly raise high hopes .
our opponents have devoted themselves in the last few weeks to the idea that the republican party is endeavoring to " scare " the american people .
i have never found them very easily scared and would not believe the american people could be .
the american people are not being disturbed by my reassurances from the record that men are being restored to employment at the rate of 500,000 a month as the result of great programs and policies inaugurated by this administration .
what is disturbing the american people is the failure of the democratic candidate to show any satisfaction in this , and his entire lack of assurance that these measures will be carried forward .
furthermore , they find a total absence of constructive proposals from the democratic side for dealing with this emergency .
they are confused by indefinite promises as to the future .
they are dismayed by the measures proposed by the last democratic house of representatives which at no time have been disavowed by the candidate and would destroy the very foundations of the republic .
they resent appeals to protest on the basis of personal misfortune the causes of which have been so brazenly misstated .
they are asking what the support of extreme radicals means to our american institutions .
they wonder if the divergent parts in the democratic party , the sectional elements and political elements of which it consists , do not spell a repetition of the quarrels and lack of confidence in their candidate so evident before their convention , and thus an earnest of their own incapacity for united national action .
one issue of this campaign has become of more than normal importance , and i wish to speak on that question -- that is , the maintenance of our protective tariff .
these states are positively dependent upon the maintenance of protective tariffs as a measure of recovery from this depression .
and the protective tariff is more in danger at this moment than at any time in recent history ; first because our opponents propose to reduce this tariff to the basis of " competitive tariff for revenue " which means competition in the american market by the lower - paid labor , lowered standards of living , and the cheapest lands in any part of the world .
but beyond this the collapse of 30 nations unable to stand the accumulated strains growing out of the world war has brought about a depreciation of their currencies all the way from 10 to 50 percent .
the result has been a further decrease in their wages , their prices and standards of living as compared to ours .
breaches are being made daily in your farm tariff walls .
i wished to make a public survey into the actual purchasing power as a consequence of wages in a number of countries to determine from their wages the amount of bread and butter which could be purchased at retail with a week 's wages .
i gave out those figures 4 years ago , and i gave them out several days ago .
they show that in the united states nearly every group of labor can purchase somewhere between 900 and 1,000 pounds of bread and butter from their weekly wage .
they showed 4 years ago that our nearest competitor , japan , delivering goods here , could purchase there all the way from 600 to 750 .
they showed several days ago that this nation could only buy 100 to 159 pounds .
that is the difference in wages .
and in the face of this , our democratic opponents propose to reduce our tariffs .
they propose to do this in violation of their historic duty and in order to appeal to other sections of the united states .
their candidate has referred to our tariff as exorbitant and a ghastly jest .
we must bear in mind that excepting wheat , 99 percent of our agricultural products in this and neighboring states are consumed within the borders of the united states , and the fate of american agriculture lies in holding the market within the boundaries of the united states .
i could give you a few indications in actual effect of the present situation other than those i stated at des moines , indianapolis , springfield .
i would point out that butter , the indicator in dairy products , sells in new york at 21 cents , and yet , except for the tariff wall , it would be sold from new zealand and europe for 16 cents .
and i would point out another exhibit : flax is 72 cents north of the canadian border and $ 1.08 south of that boundary owing to the protective tariff .
these prices are depressingly low , but they actually could be lower .
if this tariff were taken down , some 4 million acres , built up under the protective tariff , must go into other products , the competition of which will lower prices in every other commodity .
another industry to which governor roosevelt has given especial attention is sugar , as to which his promises would put another 750,000 acres into competition with other products .
one of the reasons why agriculture has not made progress as rapidly in increased prices in the last 4 months comparable with the increased employment of men is this increasing competition from depreciated currency countries .
this indeed gives me the greatest concern .
fortunately , the republican administration has been able to prevent the destruction of the flexible authorities of the tariff commission through which alone these breaches in the tariff wall might be repaired .
the democratic candidate , the democratic house of representatives , and the democratic party in its platform promise consistently to destroy this authority of the tariff commission , and i ask : can you look to these men to repair these breaches in the tariff wall when they propose to tear down the walls themselves ?
in a speech last night the democratic candidate stated that the tariff commission " during 2 long years , has investigated duties on only 73 commodities out of many thousands . "
again he has been misinformed and is broadcasting misinformation to the american people .
the tariff commission has considered over 250 items instead of the 73 he mentions .
a great number of these items , when they appeared for consideration , were found to have no basis for action .
they were withdrawn by the applicants upon a showing of the facts .
but a greater misrepresentation lies in the fact that except for the very large task that i have recently given the commission -- that is , to reconsider the tariffs as affected by depreciated currencies owing to the collapse of foreign nations -- its docket is practically clear .
that means that this tribunal , which governor roosevelt says he will destroy , has attended to practically every tariff application presented by american citizens .
if there were a greater number of items which needed change , is it not obvious that the need for this change would have been manifest , because the enterprising american citizen would long since have brought it to this tribunal for immediate adjustment ?
beyond the possibilities of adjustment by the tariff commission , we will widen the protective tariff by legislation if necessary to protect agriculture .
our oils and fats are suffering , entirely unnecessarily , from foreign imports of these commodities .
the american market should be and must be reserved for the american farmer at all times -- whether emergency times or normal times .
governor roosevelt in his address last night also stated : " i have been scrupulously careful to engage in no personalities , no unfair innuendoes , no baseless charges against the president of the united states . "
i would like to have someone else answer this , but it appears that i am the one to carry the answer across to the american people .
i would recommend that anyone interested in this statement should read governor roosevelt 's speeches from the beginning of this campaign .
i have been compelled to take the unprecedented action of calling attention to a few of them .
i have been also compelled to frequently call attention to statements being put out through the democratic national committee and their agencies which amount to positive calumnies .
in no case has the democratic candidate disavowed this action of his official committee or agencies .
he has naturally profited by his silence .
i have been informed in this state that someone is endeavoring to picture me as having voted in a foreign country as an indication that i am not a citizen of the united states .
i know it is directed from the activities of the democratic local committees .
but why answer those things ?
that picture is taken from the tax rolls of a foreign country where i at one time rented a house , and where there is a tax on every item of rent and where the rolls are made up from the tax rolls ; where i never voted or had a right to vote .
this has been privately and publicly denounced by the secretary of state over the last 8 years .
i have just heard of another of these actions which took place yesterday in the state of ohio -- the circulation of thousands of handbills stating that the farm board spends $ 5 million annually in salaries and has a fund of $ 250,000 for traveling expenses .
this statement is untrue .
there follows a long list of salaries purported to be paid by the farm board .
it states , incidentally , that mr. roosevelt will abolish the farm board .
if that be true -- but i do n't believe it is true -- that will be of interest to the 2 million members of farm cooperatives in the united states and especially in a great part of the northwest .
as to the first point , the administrative expenditures of the board are less than $ 900,000 per annum , and i would call attention to the fact that the members of the farm board receive about $ 10,000 a year .
the salaries referred to in this circular do not refer largely to the employees of the farm board .
many are exaggerated , but the great bulk of them are officials employed by farmer - owned , farmer - controlled and farmer - managed cooperatives because they have sought for the highest skill in the marketing of their products .
the farm board has no control of these salaries .
they are paid at the will of the american farmer and his organizations .
the organization you have built up in this state and the salaries are enumerated here as a matter of personal defamation of myself .
but the only point of importance for me to make now is that this is typical of stories being spread through the nation with a view to misleading the people .
i regret that i have to refer to them .
they ought to be omitted from a political discussion .
throughout the difficulties of the last 2 years there have stood out in high relief the courage and fortitude of the american people .
yet , steadfast and brave as have been our men in the face of suffering and disaster , our women have been braver and more steadfast .
upon them the rigors of the world depression , as did the rigors of the world war , have borne most heavily .
untold anxiety , self - denial , and drudgery have been their lot , that their loved ones might be assured of that care in mind and body that would equip them to meet the problems of the future .
that the health of our people , both infants and adults , as evidenced by vital statistics , is now at its highest point is a notable tribute to the loving care and devotion of the women of the united states .
today their hearts are gladdened by a well founded hope of an early return to normal living conditions in our country .
they must not be disappointed .
in the long dark days of recent months these women , bowed with the burden of their own troubles , have not been too preoccupied to send me many messages of sympathy and encouragement .
unmoved either by blind resentment or by cruel calumny , they have done much to sustain my belief in the justice as well as the courage of my countrymen .
whatever fortune may have in store for me during the remaining years of my life , my heart will ever be filled with gratitude to the women of america for the understanding , the faith , and the cooperation which they have given me without stint during all of my years of public service .
and not only in the homes of our country have women borne their full share of the burdens of the day .
more and more in the changing conditions of modern life women have had to take their places side by side with men in factories , in business , in professional , and in political life .
even before their enfranchisement , president theodore roosevelt realized the need for women in government when he appointed a woman to head his newly created children 's bureau in the department of labor , and that office has always been held by a woman .
many women are now holding posts of grave responsibility in city and county and state and nation , and their number will be greatly increased .
a step forward has been taken in the last year .
the first woman to represent the government of the united states in a great international conference is miss mary e. woolley , sent by me as a member of the american delegation to the disarmament conference at geneva .
hers was a most distinguished service .
i have appointed an imposing list of women to public duties , and they have proved to have the highest sense of service and the highest kind of ability .
since the women of america attained the vote they have naturally forced certain questions into wider attention of the nation .
education , home protection , and child welfare are as thoroughly bound up in the politics of the nation as any other issues as a result of the enfranchisement of women .
i have observed in public discussions in this campaign that women frequently take a longer view of national life than do a great many men .
that is natural with women .
they are intensely concerned with the policies which guarantee open equality of opportunity for the future of their boys and girls .
it is a comfort to find them familiar with the measures i have presented to add to this security , and they are also familiar with the lack of response with which the democratic house met these measures .
i have long experienced their courageous and tenacious abilities in organization for public purposes .
during the food administration , it was my pleasure to cooperate with the women , and it was my first opportunity to see the women who organized a nation for saving that our soldiers and allies might be fed .
soon after , it was with the women that i organized the measures to save the lives of 10 million european children .
soon after , it was with the women that i organized the better homes movement .
a few years ago , when i began to organize the white house conference on child health and protection , i discovered that the great majority fitted for leadership in that work , both by skill and experience , were women .
again , when i organized the conference on home building and home ownership and it was necessary to create research committees to present conclusions to the conference , i found the skill and spirit with which to carry on the special work largely among women in order to get a proper perspective on the subjects because they were the persons in the community that had the experience to do it .
both these conferences brought high results in the advancement of public thought .
they are already ringing through our national life in concrete public action .
i have come to know the great abilities of our womanhood for cooperative action .
they never cease nor become discouraged until success is attained .
of the great problems which demand safeguard probably none arises in higher value than that of preventing wars .
this is a primary necessity to the future of the nation .
we can not , as a people , run the risk of having our whole civilization degenerated and torn apart by such grim recurrences .
there is a fundamental source for prevention which has been too much overlooked in this campaign .
no one can deny the fact that the depression would never have taken place had it not been for the destructive forces loosened by the great war .
if we are to ensure that our country shall not be racked and endangered by recurrence of such calamities , the first measure for safety is that we should have peace in the world .
we have a vital part to play in the setup of machinery to replace war and force with the peaceful settlement of controversies between the nations .
we properly refuse to entangle ourselves in age - old controversies in other parts of the world .
our face is turned forward , not backward .
we have taken the position that we will not participate in trying to compel people to engage in the settlement of controversies by the use of force .
the kellogg pact has been advanced by this administration to a point now accepted by the world as of far greater potency than was even contemplated at the time of its inauguration .
under the policies we have advanced , we have definitely secured that the public opinion of the world will be mobilized and concentrated against those who violate that pact .
the whole history of this beautiful western country constitutes a monument to the heroism of american women ; and that pioneer spirit which bore so large a part in the development of the farms and firesides that now cover the western plains has come to its fullest expression during these later years in the assumption by women of a full measure of political responsibility as american citizens .
my deepest appreciation is given to the army of women who have borne so valiant a part in this campaign .
their lofty conception of governmental affairs and their keen understanding of political parties and issues have given a new meaning to the history of american progress .
in these closing hours , i am realizing that i have been drawn more deeply into this campaign than most presidents .
the emergencies with which we have been dealing during the past 30 years have called upon me for such continued and concentrated attention at the capital of the nation ; they have been so complicated and technical ; they have required such imperative and instant action , that when this campaign began i was forced to the realization that few other responsible officials of the government held the full knowledge of all the ramifications of a program which was not yet fully understood by the country .
i have felt that the president of the united states , constantly reviewing the history of our many struggles , knowing the character of our people , should never flinch in confidence in the future .
i deemed it due to you and to the common cause we serve to bring to you the direct story of the endeavors that have been undertaken for the common good in these past years .
in the past month i have received many thousands of communications from our people .
i wish to express to you and to them the comfort i have had in the realization they have given to me that their concern has traveled with mine as we have discussed together the grave issues of the period .
in the solemn sense that belongs to last words of this campaign , i assure you that i have endeavored , in the presentation of these issues , to appeal to the thoughtful people of the united states , that i have kept foremost in my thought the welfare of my country , that my vision has been of their homes and their necessities .
and i accept this great demonstration as evidence of the support which you are giving to me out of your convictions in this battle .
i have made no effort to appeal to destructive emotions ; i have made an endeavor to appeal to reason which i can only hope has been effective .
i have fixed my faith upon the logical conclusions of the thoughtful people who have never failed this country in any hour of danger .

certain senators have issued a public statement to the effect that unless the president and the house of representatives agree to appropriations from the federal treasury for charitable purposes they will force an extra session of congress .
i do not wish to add acrimony to a discussion , but would rather state this case as i see its fundamentals .
this is not an issue as to whether people shall go hungry or cold in the united states .
it is solely a question of the best method by which hunger and cold shall be prevented .
it is a question as to whether the american people on one hand will maintain the spirit of charity and mutual self - help through voluntary giving and the responsibility of local government as distinguished on the other hand from appropriations out of the federal treasury for such purposes .
my own conviction is strongly that if we break down this sense of responsibility of individual generosity to individual and mutual self - help in the country in times of national difficulty and if we start appropriations of this character we have not only impaired something infinitely valuable in the life of the american people but have struck at the roots of self - government .
once this has happened it is not the cost of a few score millions , but we are faced with the abyss of reliance in future upon government charity in some form or other .
the money involved is indeed the least of the costs to american ideals and american institutions .
president cleveland , in 1887 , confronted with a similar issue stated in part : 
 " a prevalent tendency to disregard the limited mission of this power and duty should , i think , be steadfastly resisted , to the end that the lesson should be constantly enforced that though the people support the government , the government should not support the people . "
the friendliness and charity of our countrymen can always be relied upon to relieve their fellow citizens in misfortune .
this has been repeatedly and quite lately demonstrated .
federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character , while it prevents the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthens the bonds of a common brotherhood . "
and there is a practical problem in all this .
the help being daily extended by neighbors , by local and national agencies , by municipalities , by industry and a great multitude of organizations throughout the country today is many times any appropriation yet proposed .
the opening of the doors of the federal treasury is likely to stifle this giving and thus destroy far more resources than the proposed charity from the federal government .
the basis of successful relief in national distress is to mobilize and organize the infinite number of agencies of self - help in the community .
that has been the american way of relieving distress among our own people and the country is successfully meeting its problem in the american way today .
we have two entirely separate and distinct situations in the country - the first is the drought area ; the second is the unemployment in our large industrial centers -- for both of which these appropriations attempt to make charitable contributions .
immediately upon the appearance of the drought last august , i convoked a meeting of the governors , the red cross and the railways , the bankers and other agencies in the country and laid the foundations of organization and the resources to stimulate every degree of self - help to meet the situation which it was then obvious would develop .
the result of this action was to attack the drought problem in a number of directions .
the red cross established committees in every drought county , comprising the leading citizens of those counties , with instructions to them that they were to prevent starvation among their neighbors and , if the problem went beyond local resources , the red cross would support them .
the organization has stretched throughout the area of suffering , the people are being cared for today through the hands and with sympathetic understanding and upon the responsibility of their neighbors who are being supported , in turn , by the fine spirit of mutual assistance of the american people .
the red cross officials , whose long , devoted service and experience is unchallenged , inform me this morning that , except for the minor incidents of any emergency organization , no one is going hungry and no one need go hungry or cold .
to reinforce this work at the opening of congress i recommended large appropriations for loans to rehabilitate agriculture from the drought and provision of further large sums for public works and construction in the drought territory which would give employment in further relief to the whole situation .
these federal activities provide for an expenditure of upward of $ 100 million in this area and it is in progress today .
the red cross has always met the situations which it has undertaken .
after careful survey and after actual experience of several months with their part of the problem they have announced firmly that they can command the resources with which to meet any call for human relief in prevention of hunger and suffering in drought areas and that they accept this responsibility .
they have refused to accept federal appropriations as not being consonant either with the need or the character of their organization .
the government departments have given and are giving them every assistance .
we possibly need to strengthen the public health service in matters of sanitation and to strengthen the credit facilities of that area through the method approved by the government departments to divert some existing appropriations to strengthen agricultural credit corporations .
in the matter of unemployment outside of the drought areas important economic measures of mutual self - help have been developed such as those to maintain wages , to distribute employment equitably , to increase construction work by industry , to increase federal construction work from a rate of about $ 275 million a year prior to the depression to a rate now of over $ 750 million a year , to expand state and municipal construction - all upon a scale never before provided or even attempted in any depression .
but beyond this to assure that there shall be no suffering , in every town and county voluntary agencies in relief of distress have been strengthened and created and generous funds have been placed at their disposal .
they are carrying on their work efficiently and sympathetically .
but after and coincidently with voluntary relief , our american system requires that municipal , county , and state governments shall use their own resources and credit before seeking such assistance from the federal treasury .
i have indeed spent much of my life in fighting hardship and starvation both abroad and in the southern states .
i do not feel that i should be charged with lack of human sympathy for those who suffer , but i recall that in all the organizations with which i have been connected over these many years , the foundation has been to summon the maximum of self - help .
i am proud to have sought the help of congress in the past for nations who were so disorganized by war and anarchy that self - help was impossible .
but even these appropriations were but a tithe of that which was coincidently mobilized from the public charity of the united states and foreign countries .
there is no such paralysis in the united states , and i am confident that our people have the resources , the initiative , the courage , the stamina and kindliness of spirit to meet this situation in the way they have met their problems over generations .
i will accredit to those who advocate federal charity a natural anxiety for the people of their states .
i am willing to pledge myself that , if the time should ever come that the voluntary agencies of the country together with the local and state governments are unable to find resources with which to prevent hunger and suffering in my country , i will ask the aid of every resource of the federal government because i would no more see starvation amongst our countrymen than would any senator or congressman .
i have the faith in the american people that such a day will not come .
the american people are doing their job today .
they should be given a chance to show whether they wish to preserve the principles of individual and local responsibility and mutual self - help before they embark on what i believe is a disastrous system .
i feel sure they will succeed if given the opportunity .
the whole business situation would be greatly strengthened by the prompt completion of the necessary legislation of this session of congress and thereby the unemployment problem would be lessened , the drought area indirectly benefited , and the resources of self - help in the country strengthened .

my countrymen : 
 this occasion is not alone the administration of the most sacred oath which can be assumed by an american citizen .
it is a dedication and consecration under god to the highest office in service of our people .
i assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of almighty providence can i hope to discharge its ever - increasing burdens .
it is in keeping with tradition throughout our history that i should express simply and directly the opinions which i hold concerning some of the matters of present importance .
our progress 
 if we survey the situation of our nation both at home and abroad , we find many satisfactions ; we find some causes for concern .
we have emerged from the losses of the great war and the reconstruction following it within creased virility and strength .
from this strength we have contributed to the recovery and progress of the world .
what america has done has given renewed hope and courage to all who have faith in government by the people .
in the large view , we have reached a higher degree of comfort and security than ever existed before in the history of the world .
through liberation from widespread poverty we have reached a higher degree of individual freedom than ever before .
the devotion to and concern for our institutions are deep and sincere .
we are steadily building a new race -- a new civilization great in its own attainments .
the influence and high purposes of our nation are respected among the peoples of the world .
we aspire to distinction in the world , but to a distinction based upon confidence in our sense of justice as well as our accomplishments within our own borders and in our own lives .
for wise guidance in this great period of recovery the nation is deeply indebted to calvin coolidge .
but all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant dangers from which self - government must be safeguarded .
the strong man must at all times be alert to the attack of insidious disease .
the most malign of all these dangers today is disregard and disobedience of law .
crime is increasing .
confidence in rigid and speedy justice is decreasing .
i am not prepared to believe that this indicates any decay in the moral fiber of the american people .
i am not prepared to believe that it indicates an impotence of the federal government to enforce its laws .
it is only in part due to the additional burdens imposed upon our judicial system by the eighteenth amendment .
the problem is much wider than that .
many influences had increasingly complicated and weakened our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment .
to reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must critically consider the entire federal machinery of justice , the redistribution of its functions , the simplification of its procedure , the provision of additional special tribunals , the better selection of juries , and the more effective organization of our agencies of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may be swift .
while the authority of the federal government extends to but part of our vast system of national , state , and local justice , yet the standards which the federal government establishes have the most profound influence upon the whole structure .
we are fortunate in the ability and integrity of our federal judges and attorneys .
but the system which these officers are called upon to administer is in many respects ill adapted to present - day conditions .
its intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals .
there is a belief abroad that by invoking technicalities , subterfuge , and delay , the ends of justice may be thwarted by those who can pay the cost .
reform , reorganization , and strengthening of our whole judicial and enforcement system , both in civil and criminal sides , have been advocated for years by statesmen , judges , and bar associations .
first steps toward that end should not longer be delayed .
rigid and expeditious justice is the first safeguard of freedom , the basis of all ordered liberty , the vital force of progress .
it must not come to be in our republic that it can be defeated by the indifference of the citizen , by exploitation of the delays and entanglements of the law , or by combinations of criminals .
justice must not fail because the agencies of enforcement are either delinquent or inefficiently organized .
to consider these evils , to find their remedy , is the most sore necessity of our times .
of the undoubted abuses which have grown up under the eighteenth amendment , part are due to the causes i have just mentioned ; but part are due to the failure of some states to accept their share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many state and local officials to accept the obligation under their oath of office zealously to enforce the laws .
with the failures from these many causes has come a dangerous expansion in the criminal elements who have found enlarged opportunities in dealing in illegal liquor .
but a large responsibility rests directly upon our citizens .
there would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminals patronized it .
we must awake to the fact that this patronage from large numbers of law - abiding citizens is supplying the rewards and stimulating crime .
i have been selected by you to execute and enforce the laws of the country .
i propose to do so to the extent of my own abilities , but the measure of success that the government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which you , as citizens , extend .
the duty of citizens to support the laws of the land is coequal with the duty of their government to enforce the laws which exist .
no greater national service can be given by men and women of good will -- who , i know , are not unmindful of the responsibilities of citizenship -- than that they should , by their example , assist in stamping out crime and outlawry by refusing participation in and condemning all transactions with illegal liquor .
our whole system of self - government will crumble either if officials elect what laws they will enforce or citizen select what laws they will support .
the worst evil of disregard for some law is that it destroys respect for all law .
for our citizens to patronize the violation of a particular law on the ground that they are opposed to it is destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life , of homes and property which they rightly claim under other laws .
if citizens do not like a law , their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation ; their right is openly to work for its repeal .
to those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous enforcement of the law .
fortunately they are but a small percentage of our people .
their activities must be stopped .
a national investigation 
 i propose to appoint a national commission for a searching investigation of the whole structure of our federal system of jurisprudence , to include the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the causes of abuse under it .
its purpose will be to make such recommendations for reorganization of the administration of federal laws and court procedure as may be found desirable .
in the meantime it is essential that a large part of the enforcement activities be transferred from the treasury department to the department of justice as a beginning of more effective organization .
the election has again confirmed the determination of the american people that regulation of private enterprise and not government ownership or operation is the course rightly to be pursued in our relation to business .
in recent years we have established a differentiation in the whole method of business regulation between the industries which produce and distribute commodities on the one hand and public utilities on the other .
in the former , our laws insist upon effective competition ; in the latter , because we substantially confer a monopoly by limiting competition , we must regulate their services and rates .
the rigid enforcement of the laws applicable to both groups is the very base of equal opportunity and freedom from domination for all our people , and it is just as essential for the stability and prosperity of business itself as for the protection of the public at large .
such regulation should be extended by the federal government within the limitations of the constitution and only when the individual states are without power to protect their citizens through their own authority .
on the other hand , we should be fearless when the authority rests only in the federal government .
the larger purpose of our economic thought should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still further from our borders .
our people have in recent years developed a new - found capacity for cooperation among themselves to effect high purposes in public welfare .
it is an advance toward the highest conception of self- government .
self - government does not and should not imply the use of political agencies alone .
progress is born of cooperation in the community -- not from governmental restraints .
the government should assist and encourage these movements of collective self- help by itself cooperating with them .
business has by cooperation made great progress in the advancement of service , in stability , in regularity of employment and in the correction of its own abuses .
such progress , however , can continue only so long as business manifests its respect for law .
there is an equally important field of cooperation by the federal government with the multitude of agencies , state , municipal and private , in the systematic development of those processes which directly affect public health , recreation , education , and the home .
we have need further to perfect the means by which government can be adapted to human service .
although education is primarily a responsibility of the states and local communities , and rightly so , yet the nation as a whole is vitally concerned in its development everywhere to the highest standards and to complete universality .
self - government can succeed only through an instructed electorate .
our objective is not simply to overcome illiteracy .
the nation has marched far beyond that .
the more complex the problems of the nation become , the greater is the need for more and more advanced instruction .
moreover , as our numbers increase and as our life expands with science and invention , we must discover more and more leaders for every walk of life .
we can not hope to succeed in directing this increasingly complex civilization unless we can draw all the talent of leadership from the whole people .
one civilization after another has been wrecked upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class .
if we would prevent the growth of class distinctions and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideals of our people , we must draw constantly from the general mass .
the full opportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective processes of education can alone secure to us this leadership .
in public health the discoveries of science have opened a new era .
many sections of our country and many groups of our citizens suffer from diseases the eradication of which are mere matters of administration and moderate expenditure .
public health service should be as fully organized and as universally incorporated into our governmental system as is public education .
the returns are a thousand fold in economic benefits , and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness .
the united states fully accepts the profound truth that our own progress , prosperity , and peace are interlocked with the progress , prosperity , and peace of all humanity .
the whole world is at peace .
the dangers to a continuation of this peace today are largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world .
no suspicion or fear can be rightly directed toward our country .
those who have a true understanding of america know that we have no desire for territorial expansion , for economic or other domination of other peoples .
such purposes are repugnant to our ideals of human freedom .
our form of government is ill adapted to the responsibilities which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other peoples .
superficial observers seem to find no destiny for our abounding increase in population , in wealth and power except that of imperialism .
they fail to see that the american people are engrossed in the building for themselves of a new economic system , a new social system , a new political system all of which are characterized by aspirations of freedom of opportunity and thereby are the negation of imperialism .
they fail to realize that because of our abounding prosperity our youth are pressing more and more into our institutions of learning;that our people are seeking a larger vision through art , literature , science , and travel ; that they are moving toward stronger moral and spiritual life -- that from these things our sympathies are broadening beyond the bounds of our nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man .
they fail to see that the idealism of america will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel , but inspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization .
it will do that not by mere declaration but by taking a practical part in supporting all useful international undertakings .
we not only desire peace with the world , but to see peace maintained throughout the world .
we wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force .
the recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy sets an advanced standard in our conception of the relations of nations .
its acceptance should pave the way to greater limitation of armament , the offer of which we sincerely extend to the world .
but its full realization also implies a greater and greater perfection in the instrumentalities for pacific settlement of controversies between nations .
in the creation and use of these instrumentalities we should support every sound method of conciliation , arbitration , and judicial settlement .
american statesmen were among the first to propose and they have constantly urged upon the world , the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversies of a justiciable character .
the permanent court of international justice in its major purpose is thus peculiarly identified with american ideals and with american statesmanship .
no more potent instrumentality for this purpose has ever been conceived and no other is practicable of establishment .
the reservations placed upon our adherence should not be misinterpreted .
the united states seeks by these reservations no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory opinions and other matters which are subsidiary to the major purpose of the court .
the way should , and i believe will , be found by which we may take our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace .
our people have determined that we should make no political engagements such as membership in the league of nations , which may commit us in advance as a nation to become involved in the settlements of controversies between other countries .
they adhere to the belief that the independence of america from such obligations increases its ability and availability for service in all fields of human progress .
i have lately returned from a journey among our sister republics of the western hemisphere .
i have received unbounded hospitality and courtesy as their expression of friendliness to our country .
we are held by particular bonds of sympathy and common interest with them .
they are each of them building a racial character and a culture which is an impressive contribution to human progress .
we wish only for the maintenance of their independence , the growth of their stability , and their prosperity .
while we have had wars in the western hemisphere , yet on the whole the record is in encouraging contrast with that of other parts of the world .
fortunately the new world is largely free from the inheritances of fear and distrust which have so troubled the old world .
we should keep it so .
it is impossible , my countrymen , to speak of peace without profound emotion .
in thousands of homes in america , in millions of homes around the world , there are vacant chairs .
it would be a shameful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandoned the hope for which all these men died .
surely civilization is old enough , surely mankind is mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace .
abroad , to west and east , are nations whose sons mingled their blood with the blood of our sons on the battlefields .
most of these nations have contributed to our race , to our culture , our knowledge , and our progress .
from one of them we derive our very language and from many of them much of the genius of our institutions .
their desire for peace is as deep and sincere as our own .
peace can be contributed to by respect for our ability in defense .
peace can be promoted by the limitation of arms and by the creation of the instrumentalities for peaceful settlement of controversies .
but it will become a reality only through self- restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness .
i covet for this administration a record of having further contributed to advance the cause of peace .
in our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effected only through the instrumentality of political parties .
we maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be given for expression of the popular will , and organization provided for the execution of its mandates and for accountability of government to the people .
it follows that the government both in the executive and the legislative branches must carry out in good faith the platforms upon which the party was entrusted with power .
but the government is that of the whole people ; the party is the instrument through which policies are determined and men chosen to bring them into being .
the animosities of elections should have no place in our government , for government must concern itself alone with the common weal .
action upon some of the proposals upon which the republican party was returned to power , particularly further agricultural relief and limited changes in the tariff , can not in justice to our farmers , our labor , and our manufacturers be postponed .
i shall therefore request a special session of congress for the consideration of these two questions .
i shall deal with each of them upon the assembly of the congress .
it appears to me that the more important further mandates from the recent election were the maintenance of the integrity of the constitution ; the vigorous enforcement of the laws ; the continuance of economy in public expenditure ; the continued regulation of business to prevent domination in the community ; the denial of ownership or operation of business by the government in competition with its citizens ; the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the controversies of foreign nations ; the more effective reorganization of the departments of the federal government ; the expansion of public works ; and the promotion of welfare activities affecting education and the home .
these were the more tangible determinations of the election , but beyond them was the confidence and belief of the people that we would not neglect the support of the embedded ideals and aspirations of america .
these ideals and aspirations are the touchstones upon which the day - to - day administration and legislative acts of government must be tested .
more than this , the government must , so far as lies within its proper powers , give leadership to the realization of these ideals and to the fruition of these aspirations .
no one can adequately reduce these things of the spirit to phrases or to a catalogue of definitions .
we do know what the attainments of these ideals should be : the preservation of self - government and its full foundations in local government ; the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social fields ; the maintenance of ordered liberty ; the denial of domination by any group or class ; the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity ; the stimulation of initiative and individuality ; absolute integrity in public affairs ; the choice of officials for fitness to office;the direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessening of poverty ; the freedom of public opinion ; the sustaining of education and of the advancement of knowledge ; the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faiths ; the strengthening of the home ; the advancement of peace .
there is no short road to the realization of these aspirations .
ours is a progressive people , but with a determination that progress must be based upon the foundation of experience .
ill - considered remedies for our faults bring only penalties after them .
but if we hold the faith of the men in our mighty past who created these ideals , we shall leave them heightened and strengthened for our children .
this is not the time and place for extended discussion .
the questions before our country are problems of progress to higher standards ; they are not the problems of degeneration .
they demand thought and they serve to quicken the conscience and enlist our sense of responsibility for their settlement .
and that responsibility rests upon you , my countrymen , as much as upon those of us who have been selected for office .
ours is a land rich in resources ; stimulating in its glorious beauty;filled with millions of happy homes ; blessed with comfort and opportunity .
in no nation are the institutions of progress more advanced .
in no nation are the fruits of accomplishment more secure .
in no nation is the government more worthy of respect .
no country is more loved by its people .
i have an abiding faith in their capacity , integrity , and high purpose .
i have no fears for the future of our country .
it is bright with hope .
in the presence of my countrymen , mindful of the solemnity of this occasion , knowing what the task means and the responsibility which it involves , i beg your tolerance , your aid , and your cooperation .
i ask the help of almighty god in this service to my country to which you have called me .

the american government proposes the postponement during 1 year of all payments on intergovernmental debts , reparations , and relief debts , both principal and interest , of course , not including obligations of governments held by private parties .
subject to confirmation by congress , the american government will postpone all payments upon the debts of foreign governments to the american government payable during the fiscal year beginning july 1 next , conditional on a like postponement for 1 year of all payments on intergovernmental debts owing the important creditor powers .
this course of action has been approved by the following senators : henry f. ashurst , hiram bingham , william e. borah , james f. byrnes , arthur capper , simeon d. fess , duncan u. fletcher , carter glass , william j. harris , pat harrison , cordell hull , william h. king , dwight w. morrow , george h. moses , david a. reed , claude a. swanson , arthur vandenberg , robert f. wagner , david i. walsh , thomas j. walsh , james e. watson ; and by the following representatives : isaac bacharach , joseph w. byrns , carl r. chindblom , frank crowther , james w. collier , charles r. crisp , thomas h. cullen , george p. darrow , harry a. estep , willis c. hawley , carl e. mapes , j. c. mclaughlin , earl c. michener , c. william ramseyer , bertrand h. snell , john 

 the purpose of this action is to give the forthcoming year to the economic recovery of the world and to help free the recuperative forces already in motion in the united states from retarding influences from abroad .
the worldwide depression has affected the countries of europe more severely than our own .
some of these countries are feeling to a serious extent the drain of this depression on national economy .
the fabric of intergovernmental debts , supportable in normal times , weighs heavily in the midst of this depression .
from a variety of causes arising out of the depression such as the fall in the price of foreign commodities and the lack of confidence in economic and political stability abroad there is an abnormal movement of gold into the united states which is lowering the credit stability of many foreign countries .
these and the other difficulties abroad diminish buying power for our exports and in a measure are the cause of our continued unemployment and continued lower prices to our farmers .
wise and timely action should contribute to relieve the pressure of these adverse forces in foreign countries and should assist in the reestablishment of confidence , thus forwarding political peace and economic stability in the world .
authority of the president to deal with this problem is limited as this action must be supported by the congress .
it has been assured the cordial support of leading members of both parties in the senate and the house .
the essence of this proposition is to give time to permit debtor governments to recover their national prosperity .
i am suggesting to the american people that they be wise creditors in their own interest and be good neighbors .
i wish to take this occasion also to frankly state my views upon our relations to german reparations and the debts owed to us by the allied governments of europe .
our government has not been a party to , or exerted any voice in determination of reparation obligations .
we purposely did not participate in either general reparations or the division of colonies or property .
the repayment of debts due to us from the allies for the advance for war and reconstruction were settled upon a basis not contingent upon german reparations or related thereto .
therefore , reparations is necessarily wholly a european problem with which we have no relation .
i do not approve in any remote sense of the cancellation of the debts to us .
world confidence would not be enhanced by such action .
none of our debtor nations have ever suggested it .
but as the basis of the settlement of these debts was the capacity under normal conditions of the debtor to pay , we should be consistent with our own policies and principles if we take into account the abnormal situation now existing in the world .
i am sure the american people have no desire to attempt to extract any sum beyond the capacity of any debtor to pay and it is our view that broad vision requires that our government should recognize the situation as it exists .
this course of action is entirely consistent with the policy which we have hitherto pursued .
we are not involved in the discussion of strictly european problems , of which the payment of german reparations is one .
it represents our willingness to make a contribution to the early restoration of world prosperity in which our own people have so deep an interest .
i wish further to add that while this action has no bearing on the conference for limitation of land armaments to be held next february , inasmuch as the burden of competitive armaments has contributed to bring about this depression , we trust that by this evidence of our desire to assist we shall have contributed to the good will which is so necessary in the solution of this major question .

i have been asked by two of your members to discuss something of the british demonetization or departure from the gold standard .
i can only do that by way of background .
i can not make a public statement in the matter .
i think you will understand that this situation has been pending for a good many months .
there has been a large amount of british investment in the united states , and that amount , estimated by the department of commerce , aggregates something over $ 1,500 million .
that is not flight of capital but steadily increasing expenditures here which naturally affects the exchanges .
it has taken place not only in the past few months but for some years back .
that , of course , has affected the problem of exchange .
there has been some piling up of immediate cash in our banks from that quarter .
the course resolved upon by the british government creates some temporary dislocations in the international world , but they are due more to the confusion arising out of readjustment of quotations and values than in their effect on the values of either securities or commodities .
the first effect of the decrease in the gold value of the pound is a rise in prices of commodities in great britain , at least in all international commodities where the price is made by international action , such as in wheat and other raw materials .
there is involved a large amount of transaction based on the readjustment of those prices .
a certain amount of confusion comes out of that , and the effect on our commodity markets has been a decrease in prices .
there has been a rise in price in england in consequence and our prices are practically unchanged yesterday and today .
the fact that the pound is taken off its fixed value of $ 4.86 is not the abandonment of the gold standard even for the pound ; as international commerce revolves in these days all transactions will be measured in some gold value , whether in dollars , francs , gulden , or any other of the fixed gold currencies .
no transaction can take place unless it has some basis of measurement of that character .
it really means that the fixed gold standard has been abandoned and a variable standard adopted which may change momentarily .
but in any event all values in international commerce are bound to revolve on gold values or some measuring stick in gold .
it is more or less a case of abandoning a fixed standard and adopting a variable one so far as international commerce is concerned .
the effect in england will undoubtedly be to increase exports , which amounts to price reduction compared with the standard of measurement in gold , and it should act as a stimulant and thus should increase employment and increase the demand again for raw materials .
obviously , it amounts to a reduction in standards of living temporarily in those commodities which are imported , of course raw materials , but wages and rank will lag behind .
production costs will be lower , and consequently , exports will be stimulated .
the tendency also may be to decrease imports to some extent especially for highly competitive goods .
on the export side , the effect is not going to be very material on the united states because there are comparatively small volume of british and american goods which are highly competitive in neutral markets .
a study made some time ago of the argentine showed that there were only about 10 percent of the exports of the united states to the argentine and correspondingly 10 percent of the british exports to the argentine that were competitive .
we are exporting goods which we can peculiarly produce to the best advantage , and it might mean competition in respect to that small fraction over toward the neutral market .
but it would not be any appreciable volume .
there might be some decrease in imports into great britain , especially in luxuries , but our trade with great britain consists largely of raw materials and manufactured goods .
if there is stimulation of british exports our exports would be more likely to increase than decrease .
i mention that only to indicate that the effect of it is not as far - reaching as some people may think .
on the financial side there are no consequential balances of american banks in england .
they will always have sufficient of their own capital .
so there are no losses there of any consequence at all .
all together the action , no doubt necessary on the british side , is not , we feel , going to have any great effect in the united states .
the probabilities are that it will considerably improve the situation in england , and we will benefit in the long run .
in any event , when there is a question pending over the world 's economic life , the actual realization of it is much less severe on us than is the constant possibility of it such as has been the case for the past 3 or 4 months .
all together if we are going to have an important economic shift it is better to have it over than to have it hanging about .
you will realize also that this is not the first time that the pound has been off the gold basis .
i do not know of any nation in the world which manages to maintain through its national life the gold value of its currency .
there was a long period in the united states after the civil war when we certainly could not maintain it .
the pound was off the gold basis from some point in the war to 3 , 4 , or 5 years afterwards , but gradually the economic situation readjusts itself .
these things are temporary and go back again to their original position .
and that is all i have today .

my fellow citizens , my friends in indianapolis , and may i also include senator watson , for i wish to add that he must be your next senator -- we require his services in washington : 
 now , my fellow citizens , my major purpose tonight is to discuss those long - view policies by which we not only cement recovery but also by which we secure over the years the enlarged comfort and the steady progress of the american people .
i propose to contrast them with the ideas which have been developed by the democratic house of representatives , the democratic platform , and the democratic candidate in the course of this campaign .
when i refer to the views of these groups i wish to say at once that i do not refer to all members of the democratic party .
many of them , as in 1896 and in 1928 , have signified their intention to support us against these notions .
i also wish on all occasions to pay tribute to those democratic members of the congress who supported the unprecedented measures which we presented during the course of the last winter and through which we saved this country from destruction and chaos .
i would like also to reiterate the statement which i recently made at detroit , that the most important issue before the american people right now is to overcome this crisis , that we may secure a restoration of normal jobs to our unemployed , recovery of our agricultural prices and of our business , and that we may extend generous help in the meantime to tide our people over until these fundamental restorations are established .
i pointed out on that occasion that the battle has now changed from a successful defense of our country from disaster and chaos to forward marching attack on a hundred fronts through a score of instrumentalities and weapons toward recovery .
since that time i have had further positive evidence showing that the measures and policies that we have set in motion are driving the forces of depression into further retreat with constantly increasing rapidity .
if there shall be no change in the strategy of this battle , if there shall be no delay and hesitation , we shall have the restoration of men and women to their normal jobs and we shall have that lift to agriculture from its anxieties and its losses .
but before i begin the major discussion of the evening , i wish to take a moment of your time to revert to those methods and policies for protection and recovery from this depression in the light of certain recent misstatements of the democratic candidate in respect to them .
i presume the governor of new york will announce that i am acting upon the defensive if i shall expose the self - interested inexactitude which he has broadcasted to the american people .
i am equally prepared to defend , attack , or expound .
i shall not be deterred from my purpose to lay before the people of the united states the truth as to the issues which they confront , and i shall do it with a sense of responsibility of one who has carried out and must carry into effect these issues .
i wish to call your attention to the fact that the governor of new york in a speech on october 25 stated : 
 " this crash came in october 1929 .
the president had at his disposal all of the instrumentalities of the government .
from that day until december 31 , 1931 , he did absolutely nothing to remedy the situation .
not only did he do nothing , but he took the position that congress could do nothing . "
that is the end of the quotation , and it is a charge which extends over the first 2 years and 2 months of this depression .
it seems almost incredible that a man , a candidate for the presidency of the united states , would broadcast such a violation of the truth .
the front pages of every newspaper in the united states for the whole of those 2 years proclaimed the untruth of that statement .
and i need remind you but of a few acts of the administration to demonstrate what i say .
the governor dismisses the agreements brought about between the leaders of industry and labor under my assistance less than 1 month after the crash by which wages of literally millions of men and women were , for the first time in 15 depressions of a century , held without reduction until after profits had ceased and the cost of living had decreased .
he ignores the fact that today real wages in the united states are higher than at any other depression period , higher in purchasing power than in any other country in the world .
and above all , he dismisses the healing effect of that great agreement by which this country has been kept free from industrial strife and class conflicts .
he would suppress from the american people the knowledge of the undertaking brought about within 2 months after the crash amongst the industries of the united states to divide the existing work in such fashion as to give millions of families some measure of income instead of discharging a large portion of them into destitution , as had always been the case in previous depressions and was the case abroad .
he ignores the fact that these agreements have held until this day for the staggering unemployment .
if the governor will look up his own files of his official correspondence , he will find that within a month after the crash i appealed to him , amongst the other governors , for cooperation in creating employment and stabilization of wages , in which i set out to him the gravity of the national situation and urged that he should present in turn the great need to the counties and cities of his state .
if he says nothing was done , it was a violation of the promise which he wrote to me on that occasion .
nevertheless , the other states and the municipalities , including the great state of indiana , entered into the general definite organization between the states to increase construction work in relief of unemployment during the winters not only of 1930 but of 1931 .
not only were federal , state , and municipal agencies mobilized , but private agencies were mobilized to that end .
and by this , the governor seems to have forgotten , i succeeded in reversing the whole usual process of decreasing construction work of this character in time of depression .
this type of work was increased during the first year of the depression by over $ 800 million above normal , thus giving a living to thousands of families who otherwise would have been destitute .
the governor says nothing had been done .
the governor would also suppress the fact of the mobilization of the american people under my direction during the winters of 1930 and ' 31 of private charity and of public support to relief of distress in every town , village , and hamlet in the united states through which we carried them over these winters without serious suffering or loss , as is proved by the public health statistics of today .
the governor can not be ignorant of the recommendations which i made to the congress within a month after the crash , and again in the session a year later , for the great increase of federal public works in aid of employment , and he can not be ignorant of the appropriations made at my recommendation for the care of farmers stricken by drought or the public funds raised under my leadership for these purposes .
the governor ignores the most patent fact in the history of this depression : that , under the wise policies pursued by this administration , recovery of the united states from the first phase of the depression - that is , the collapse from our own speculation and boom -- began about a year after the crash and continued definitely and positively until april 1931 , when the general world crash took place which was not of our doing .
the governor is probably ignorant of the international measures taken to limit the extension of this prairie fire under american leadership .
he ignores the german moratorium and the standstill agreements in june 1931 , which not only saved germany from complete collapse but prevented much of the extended distress from reaching the united states .
he neglects the creation , after the collapse of england , of the national credit corporation with a capital of $ 500 million in cooperation amongst american banks , which saved over 700 institutions involving the deposits of upwards of 10 millions of our people , and that was doing something .
the governor entirely misrepresents the fact that the plan to meet this crisis which swept upon us from europe was proposed by me to the political leaders of the united states at a white house conference on october 6 , 1931 .
he ignores the fact that that plan was laid before the congress by a message on december 8 , and that it was not the creation of the democratic leaders at the end of december , as he would imply .
although the leaders of the democratic party had promised 14 months before they would produce a plan , they produced no plan until they began their destructive program some months later .
and not one of those acts has been disavowed by the governor .
he ignores the fact that the unprecedented measures proposed and carried through by the administration with the help of some of the democratic colleagues in the congress would have put us on the road to recovery 8 months ago instead of having had to await the adjournment of the democratic house of representatives only 4 months ago .
and again the governor , despite every proof , keeps reiterating the implication that the measures taken by this administration have had no fruitful result to the common man .
he has been told , at least by some of the men who advise him in this campaign , that the gigantic crisis with which the united states was faced was escaped by the narrowest margins and that it was due to unprecedented measures adopted by this administration .
if some of these men will tell him the whole truth , they will tell him that they personally sought to buy and withdraw large sums of gold because of their belief that we could not maintain the gold reserves of the united states .
would it not be well that every american citizen should take pride in the fact that america carried this nation through this crisis safely and soundly and did it as a matter of national and united action ?
why can not the governor of new york be frank enough to recognize the successful care of the distressed in the united states ; that a vast amount of employment has been provided by cooperative action amongst our citizens ; that the savings of more than 95 percent of the depositors in our banks have been held secure ; that the 20 million borrowers who otherwise would have been bankrupt by destructive pressures from forced selling of their assets in order to pay their debts have been protected ; that the 70 million life insurance policies which represent the greatest act of self - denial of a people in provision for the future safety of their loved ones have been sustained in their vitality ; and foreclosure of hundreds of thousands of mortgages upon homes and farms has been prevented ?
those are national accomplishments for which the whole american people are proud .
the governor knows that the integrity of our currency has been sustained , that the credit of the federal government has been maintained , that credit and employment are being expanded day by day .
the living proof of these measures , which were conceived from the human heart as well as the human mind , can be found in the men and women in every city , every town , every township , and every block in this broad land , for they have been saved their jobs and their homes and secured from suffering and that by the action of the american people as a whole .
i have stated that my major purpose this evening is to speak upon some of the continuing policies of this administration and the republican party in contrast with the policies of our opponents .
many of these continuing policies are dealt with in our platform .
i dealt with some of them in my acceptance speech .
some have developed in the course of this campaign .
having had the responsibility of this office for 30 years , my views upon most public questions are already set out in many cases in the public record and by definite public action .
i do not have to engage in promises in respect to them .
i may point to performance .
the opposition has shown its true purposes by its legislation in the last session of the democratic house of representatives , through their platform , and through the statements or evasions of their candidate .
of these subjects i may first refer to the tariff .
in a recent speech , in discussing the agricultural tariffs , i pointed out the specific disaster to our farms from the democratic proposal to reduce the protective tariff .
i pointed out that the democratic party had , in 1913 , not been content with merely lowering the tariff , but had put a large part of the farm products on the free list .
i pointed out that the republican party had passed an emergency farm tariff bill in 1921 , as soon as they had a majority in the congress , and that a democratic president had vetoed it .
i pointed out that the democratic minority in congress , in 1921 , had voted against the revival of the emergency farm tariff , and that the republican majority had passed it , and a republican president had signed it .
i pointed out that the democratic minority had voted against an increase in agricultural tariffs in the republican tariff act of 1922 .
i pointed out that most of the democratic members of congress voted against the bill carrying the increases in tariffs on agricultural products in the special session of congress which i called in 1929 for that purpose on which occasion we passed the hawley - smoot bill .
in the light of this historic attitude it is but natural that our opponents express their bitter opposition to the republican tariff .
they have habitually voted against these tariffs .
and now they propose in their platform a " competitive tariff for revenue , " and they denounce the smoot - haw ley bill which is mainly devoted to the increase of farm tariffs .
the democratic candidate from the day of his nomination iterated and reiterated that he proposed to reduce the tariff .
he stated that it was an unwarranted increase in the tariff .
during the first 7 weeks of this campaign he not only adopted the historic position of his party , but he constantly repeats their platform , and has reinforced it by repeated statements , as for instance : 
 " i support the competitive tariff for revenue . "
" the tariff law of 1932 was a drastic revision of the tariff upward in spite of the fact that the existing tariff levels were already high enough to protect american industries . "
" we sit on the high wall of the hawley - smoot tariff . "
" i condemn the hawley - smoot tariff . "
" a wicked and exorbitant tariff . "
" sealed by the highest tariff in the history of the world . "
" our policy declares for lowered tariffs . "
" a ghastly jest of the tariff . "
mr. roosevelt and his party knew that the major increases in the hawley - smoot act were farm tariffs when that platform was drawn , and he knew it was in effect when he made the statements that i have quoted .
the evidence is complete that he and they intend to reduce the farm tariffs .
during the past 3 weeks i have reiterated this plain and evident purpose of their party and their candidate .
unquestionably my exposition has given their candidate great anxiety , because on the 25th of this month some 6 or 7 days ago , just 21 days after my first statement on the subject he announced another new deal .
i call this a new shuffle .
he now announces within 2 weeks of the election that he does not propose to reduce tariffs on farm products .
this is the most startling shift in position by a presidential candidate : in the midst of a political campaign in all recent political history .
what do you think grover cleveland or samuel tilden or woodrow wilson would have said to such a shift as that ?
does the candidate realize that he has overnight thrown overboard the great historic position of his party ?
that he has rewritten the democratic platform ?
does he realize that he must withdraw large parts of the speeches in which he has denounced this hawley - smoot bill as the origin of all the world 's calamity ?
i have the privilege of informing him that 66 percent of all the duties collected on all of the imports into the united states are directly on imports of agricultural origin and the reduction of which would affect american farmers .
are we to take it that all the diatribes we have heard from the democratic orators throughout this campaign are in respect to only one - third of the american tariffs ?
for just 7 days ago the democratic candidate said , " the hawley - smoot tariff law carried the decline in world trade , and what amounted to a world calamity became a general international calamity . "
since that time he must have concluded that the farm tariffs have done the world no harm .
you will further remember that under the tariff act two - thirds of our imports are free of duty , and now he excludes two - thirds of the remaining one - third that are dutiable .
does the democratic party now pretend that this terrible world calamity which we have encountered was caused by the tariffs on one - ninth of the imports into the united states ?
and further , do they know -- and they do know -- that of this one - ninth of the imports of nonagricultural commodities less than one - half of them were increased by the hawley - smoot tariff bill ?
now to continue our mathematical explorations a little further , i 'm wondering if they pretend that this calamity was caused by increase of tariffs on one - eighteenth of the imports of the united states ?
and i may pursue this mathematical course still further .
do they recognize that the whole of our imports , that is , the imports of the united states , constitute less than 12 percent of the imports of the world all taken together , and thus , in this revised view , the increased duties on one - eighteenth of one - twelfth or less than one - half of 1 percent of the world 's import trade brought about this gigantic calamity by which 30 nations failed or gone to revolution .
should not the democratic candidate now at last search in the aftermath of the world war for the origins of our difficulties and stop this nonsense ?
i wish to extend this discussion a little further .
it is desirable that the governor may explain himself some further on other tariff questions .
does he include the reduction of the tariff on cotton textiles , so largely manufactured in the south ?
i have included but a part of the textile duties in the agricultural tariffs -- the tariffs on agricultural products - inasmuch as only a part of the raw cotton is dutiable .
and i wonder whether he proposes to close up the southern cotton mills ?
in view of this new light of maintaining tariffs , i wonder if he has considered the grievous position that the oil industry might be in in the states of california , oklahoma , texas , and kansas , if they are left out ?
has he considered the copper industry in the states of arizona , montana , michigan , and utah ?
has he considered the tariffs on metal and other products which affect the welfare of the whole of the people of new england , new york , pennsylvania , california , new jersey , ohio , indiana , illinois , west virginia , and other states ?
has he considered the tariff on pottery and chemicals and its effect upon new jersey , ohio , indiana , illinois , new york , pennsylvania , west virginia , california , and a lot of other states ?
and will he consider the tariffs on lumber and their effect on oregon , washington , california , and wisconsin ?
if we are going to retreat from a reduction of the tariff those people ought to have some word of comfort also .
perhaps if he would give the same consideration as to the effect of reducing the tariff for these other people , he will come to the same conclusion as that which he has been forced to come by this debate in respect to agriculture .
now , if political exigencies have forced this temporary conversion on agricultural products , how far is the governor authorized to change at will the traditional policies and the platform of the democratic party ?
how far can he guarantee to bring with him the democratic members of the house and the senate who voted against the bills carrying the increases in agricultural tariffs , and how about the men who wrote that plank in the democratic platform ?
now do you who are farmers believe in eleventh - hour conversion ?
do you consider that your livelihood is safe in the hands of the traditional and the present enemy of the protective tariff ?
perhaps the governor and the whole democratic party will now withdraw and apologize for the defamation to which i have been subjected for the past 2 years because i called a special session of the congress and secured an increase in agricultural tariffs .
now i am , myself , taking heart over this debate .
if it could be continued long enough , i believe we could drive him from every solitary position he has taken in this campaign .
they are equally untenable .
but even on the tariff , he perhaps remembers the dreadful experience of the chameleon on the scotch plaid .
and i can illustrate this to you .
as to the balance of the protective tariffs , unless this late conversion extends further than agriculture , he proposes to reduce them in the face of the fact that during the last 12 months there has been a violent change in the economy of the entire world through the depreciation of currencies in some 30 european nations and thus a lowering of their standards of living and the creation of still greater differences between the costs of production in the united states and abroad .
now , the republican party is squarely for the protective tariff .
i refuse to put the american workers and farmers into further unemployment and misery by any such action as the unrepented principles of their members of the democratic congress and their platform .
the governor 's new shuffle , however , requires that he give some further assurances to our farmers in order to make it consistent .
the democratic house of representatives and their allies in the senate passed a bill directing me to call an international conference for the purpose of reducing tariffs .
the governor has supported this in his program .
that means that we should surrender to foreigners the determination of a policy which we have zealously held under american control for nearly 150 years , ever since the first protective tariff was enacted under george washington 's administration .
this would , in that manner , place the fate of american workers and american farmers in the hands of foreign nations , and i vetoed the bill .
but the point that i wish to make now is that the governor should give to the farmers that if he calls this conference which he has assured he will do , that he will exempt agricultural tariffs from the discussion therein .
further than this the democratic party and their candidate propose to enter upon reciprocal tariffs .
that idea is not entirely new in our history , although it is a violation of what has now become a firmly fixed principle of uniform and equal treatment of all nations without preferences , concessions , or discriminations .
it is just such concessions and discriminations that are producing today a large part of the frictions over tariffs in europe .
i suppose our democratic friends blame these european tariff wars on the hawley - smoot bill .
though reciprocal tariffs are a violation of well - established american principles , this nation has fallen from grace at times and attempted to do this very thing .
at one time 22 such treaties were negotiated for this purpose .
congress refused to confirm 16 of them ; 2 of the remaining failed of confirmation by other governments ; and 4 others were so immaterial as to be forgotten .
on another occasion congress conferred on the executive a limited authority to make treaties of this character .
twenty - two of them were agreed upon , all of which were repealed by tariff acts .
now this demonstrates just one thing : that in an intelligent democracy you can not surrender the welfare of one industry or one locality in order to gain something for another .
but there is an overriding objection to a reciprocal tariff upon which the governor 's new shuffle requires that he give these further assurances to the farmers .
the vast majority of the wishes of foreign countries about our tariffs is to get us to reduce our farm tariffs so that they may enter our agricultural market .
the only concessions that we could grant through reciprocal tariffs of any great importance would be at the cost of our farmers .
since the governor has assured the nation of a policy of reciprocal tariffs , he should give an assurance to the farmers that the farm tariffs will not be included and that he will abandon the whole idea of reciprocal tariffs in relation to agriculture .
this , of course , takes away the whole foundation of the trading value in reciprocal tariffs .
and we may as well abandon the further discussion of that in this campaign .
in all this discussion about reducing tariffs it should be remembered that if any one of the rates or schedules in our tariff is too high , it has been open to our opponents during the whole of the last session of the house of representatives to pass a simple resolution and thereby secure its review by the tariff commission .
did they do that ?
they did not .
the establishment of the tariff commission with this authority destroyed one of the campaign methods of the democratic party , and that was to conduct their campaigns by exhibiting kettles and pans to the housewives of the nation and explaining what unjust cost was imposed upon them by the tariff .
now that maneuver is no longer effective , with the bipartisan tariff commission open to give remedy to the housewives of the united states .
the democrats propose , in fact , passed a bill in the last session in the lower house , to destroy the authority of the bipartisan tariff commission by which it may change the tariff so as to correct inequities or to alter the schedules to meet the changing tides of an economic world .
thus , they propose to return to the old logrolling , the old orgies of greed , viciousness , and stagnation of business during general congressional action in review of the tariff .
the increased authority to the bipartisan tariff commission to make changes in the tariff with the approval of the president was brought about at my insistence , and with the sterling courage of your senator , 2 years ago .
that was the greatest reform in tariff legislation in half a century .
and it originated from theodore roosevelt .
no better example of the vital importance of the flexible tariff exists than today , when we are in the crisis of men and women being thrown out of employment due to depreciated currencies abroad and of low - priced farm products moving over our borders .
the commission is today reexamining the new differences in the cost of production at home and abroad that action may be taken to restore men and women to their jobs .
sound public policy maintains the necessity of this commission and its authorities .
the democratic policy is to destroy it , but perhaps the governor of new york will offer us a new deal in this matter , also .
now , related to the tariff , the democratic candidate proposes to place the payment of the war debts owed to us by foreign countries squarely on the shoulders of the american workman and the american farmer by lowering the tariffs for this special purpose .
he would let down the bars to the american market for foreign commodities to the extent necessary that foreign nations may collect from the profits of their manufactures the money with which to pay these debts .
will he now exclude the 66 percent of dutiable imports , which are farm products , from this proposal ?
my own view in opposition to cancellation of the war debts is a matter of public record through many public statements and messages to congress .
i have proposed that if opportunity offers we should use the foreign debts , payment by payment , to expand foreign markets for our labor and our own farmers .
that is not cancellation and that is the reverse of the announced policy of the democratic candidate .
at no point in this campaign have our opponents stated clearly and definitely their position on immigration .
i have looked for it .
i may have overlooked it .
if i have i apologize .
i have stated that i favor rigidly restricted immigration .
i endeavored to secure from the congress the return of the quota bases from the national origins to the base previously given .
i have recommended that a more humane provision should be made for bringing in the near relatives of our citizens .
i shall persist in these matters .
i have limited immigration by administrative order during the depression in order to relieve us of unemployment or , alternatively , to save the jobs of our people who are now at work .
two years prior to that order going into effect slightly under half a million immigrants came into the united states .
since it went into effect , more have gone out of the united states than have come in .
the distressed people with lowered standards of living that would have come in would have been a far greater addition to our unemployed than even this amount .
the democratic candidate , incidentally , overlooked that little item in stating that the republican administration had done nothing in the first 2 years and 2 months of this depression .
i have repeatedly recommended to the congress a revision of our railway transportation laws in order that we might create greater stability and greater assurance in this vital service of transportation .
the regulation should be extended to other forms of carriers , both to prevent the cutthroat destruction going on in their own business amongst themselves and to prevent their destruction of the other great major arm of our transportation .
i have set this matter out in numerous messages to the congress .
i have supported the recommendations of the interstate commerce commission , which are specific and not generalities .
our opponents have adopted my program in this matter during this campaign except for certain glittering generalizations , as to which they do not inform us how they are to be accomplished and upon which i enter a reservation .
i have repeatedly recommended the federal regulation of interstate power .
i stated as early as 7 years ago that " glass pockets are the safety of the industry as well as of the public . "
i secured the creation of an independent power commission by congress 2 years ago under the leadership of your senator .
i have opposed and i will continue to oppose , the federal government going into the power business and the further extension of federal bureaucracy .
the intention of many of the men at least that are campaigning for the democratic party and under the auspices of and with money provided by the democratic national committee , are certainly to put the government into the power business , and it would seem that they must have confidence that their notions will be put over by the democratic candidate .
the democratic candidate assures us that he will preserve the great water powers of the country for the people .
that is already provided by the law passed 20 years ago - passed in 1920 - -and it , therefore , presents no difficulty to vigorous campaign promises .
in my acceptance speech i stated that this depression had exposed many weaknesses in our economic system .
it has shown much wrongdoing .
there has been exploitation and abuse of financial power .
these weaknesses must be corrected , and that wrongdoing must be punished .
we will continue to reform such abuses and correct such wrongdoing as falls within the powers of the federal government .
furthermore , the american people must have protection from insecure banking through a stronger banking system .
they must have relief from conditions which permit the credit machinery of the country being made available without adequate check for wholesale speculation in securities , with its ruinous consequences to millions of our citizens and to our national economy .
this the federal reserve system by its present constitution has proven incapable of bringing about .
i recommended to the congress the sane reform of our banking laws .
the democratic house of representatives did not see fit to pass that legislation in the last session , but we shall persist until it has been accomplished .
about a year ago , i recommended to the congress an emergency relief to our depositors in closed banks that through temporary use of the credit of the federal government a substantial portion of their assets should be forthwith distributed in order to relieve distress and to enable depositors to reestablish their business .
the democratic congress refused to pass such legislation in the last session , except for a minor provision of authority to the reconstruction corporation which does not reach to the heart of the question .
the democratic candidate and his corps of orators have not yet disclosed their position on this subject .
it concerns the welfare of 4 or 5 million americans .
we have listened to much prattle from the opposition about reducing government expenses .
having a record of earnest performance , i naturally exposed those insincerities in the last address which i made at detroit .
my only comment on this occasion is that if i receive a mandate from the american people in this election , i shall be able not only to force upon this democratic house real economies , but i shall be able to stop further raids by the democratic party on the treasury of the united states .
now , through some misinformation presented to him , the democratic candidate has annexed , as if it were a new discovery , the recommendations which i made in 1922 and have been continuously advocating ever since for the reorganization of the whole federal administrative structure for purposes of economy by consolidation of bureaus and the elimination of useless boards and commissions .
the candidate in a speech 3 days ago was thus led to misrepresent the present situation in suggesting that i , having these powers , had not executed them .
he did not realize that the congress having no longer been able to oppose this reform , did pass a measure during the last session granting such an authority to the executive to bring it about .
they , however , denied my request for immediate action , except on minor questions , and made that authority dependent upon the approval of the congress , which can not be given before next march under the terms of the law .
if the democratic candidate will read the law and inform himself fully on the subject i have no doubt he will withdraw that statement .
i recently gave an address at des moines devoted largely to specific measures now in action and to be put in action for agriculture .
i also , likewise at cleveland , gave an extended exposition of the measures and policies which we have in action and propose for labor and employment .
i am in hopes that these statements may be carefully considered , and our time is too short this evening to go into those items in detail although i hope to take them up again in this campaign .
one of the most important issues of the campaign arises from the fact that the democratic candidate has not yet disavowed the bill passed by the democratic house of representatives under the leadership of the democratic candidate for vice president to issue $ 2,300 million of greenback currency -- that is , unconvertible paper money .
that is money purporting to come from the horn of plenty but with the death 's head engraved upon it .
tampering with the currency has become a perennial policy of the democratic party .
the republican party has had to repel that many times before now .
in the absence of any declaration by the democratic candidate on this subject during 7 weeks of this campaign , no delayed promise now can efface that policy .
the taint of it is firmly embedded in the democratic party , and the dangers are embedded in this election .
if you want to know what this " new deal " and this sort of money does to a people , ask any of your neighbors who have relatives in europe , especially in germany .
i have stated that i do not favor the prepayment of the soldiers ' bonus of $ 2,300 million .
it was passed by the last democratic house of representatives .
it will no doubt be attempted again .
the democratic candidate has not yet stated to the american people fairly and squarely what his attitude will be upon that subject .
the reasons why i do not approve of it can be illustrated by the father who in a generous moment promised his young son a bonus of $ 100 when he was 21 years old .
that boy was led to ask his father for the $ 100 13 years in advance .
his father said : " times are bad .
i am hard - pressed .
i have to bring up and educate a great many children , and i have n't the money .
i am placing $ 5 per annum in the savings bank and as it is compounded it will amount to the $ 100 when you are 21 years old . "
some of his friends added that he might pay the boy in stage money .
now , the moral of that story is that you can not eat your loaf of compound interest before the dough has had time to rise .
and the further political moral of that story is that it was said by the father 's political opponents that his son would never vote for his father for public office .
there is no one in high public office who knows better than i do from personal observation the service given by the youth of this country in the great war .
i have insisted upon their care when in distress .
i have expanded the services given to the veterans at the cost of much personal criticism .
but with all of my regard and my feeling i can not endanger the stability of this country in this special demand of a part of the veterans or any other special group .
someone just asked the difference between this payment and the loans given by the reconstruction corporation .
there is just this difference : one of them is a large gift from the government and the other is loans upon security for a period of 6 months only .
but of one thing i will assure the veterans , and that is , when they are paid , they will be paid in real american money .
during the past few weeks the democratic candidate has had a great deal to say in endeavoring to establish the idea in the minds of the american people that i am personally responsible for the bad loans by american bankers and investors to numerous foreign countries .
he says : " this is an unsavory chapter in american finance . "
i agree with part of that . "
these bonds are in large part the fruit of the distressing policies pursued by the present administration in washington .
none other , if you please , than the ability of lending to backward and crippled countries . "
that is the end of the quotation from him .
the governor does not inform the american people that there is no federal law regulating the sale of securities and that there is doubtful constitutional authority for such a law .
and he fails to state that most of these bonds are issued from the state of new york , which sovereignty has such an authority , and where the government has done nothing of a reform to that evil , if it be one .
i recollect a republican governor of new york who , believing that wrong was being done to the citizens of his own and other states on life insurance , found a man named charles evans hughes who cleaned that mess up once and for all .
the governor has not stated to the american people my oft - repeated warnings that american loans made in foreign countries should be upon sound security and confined to reproductive purposes .
i have defined these loans as being the loans made for creative enterprise on which their own earnings would repay interest and capital .
in one of his addresses the governor pretends at least not to understand what a reproductive loan is , and yet , as i will show you in a moment , he does know something about it .
i will say at once that when we have surplus capital , properly secured loans for reproductive purposes abroad are an advantage to the american people .
they furnish work to american labor in the manufacture of plants and equipments ; they furnish continuing demand for american labor in supplies and replacements .
the effect of such creative enterprise is to increase the standards of living amongst the people in those localities and enable them to buy more american products and furnish additional work for american labor .
i have no apologies to make for that statement .
it is sound ; it makes for the upbuilding of the world ; it makes for employment of american workmen and profits for american investors .
if it be followed there would be no losses .
in these statements made by the governor he entirely omits the conditions and warnings with which i have repeatedly surrounded the statements upon this subject and the warnings which indeed i have given broadcast over the last 7 years in respect to this type of investment .
although no federal official has any authority to control the security offered on these loans , none of them have defaulted where the safeguards proposed by me have been followed .
it is obvious from the governor 's many speeches that he now considers that all foreign loans are wrong .
he seems to consider the selling of foreign bonds in our country to be wicked and the cause of our calamities .
and an interesting part of all this tirade is that i have never yet been engaged in the selling of foreign bonds and foreign loans .
i have not been accused of that .
the governor , however , has an advantage over me in experience in that particular .
as late as 1928 the governor was engaged in that business for profit and actively occupied in promotion of such loans .
at that time he was the chairman of the organization committee of the federal international banking company , a corporation organized for the selling of foreign securities and bonds to the american people .
i have in my hand a prospectus of that corporation in which the foreword , written by mr. roosevelt before he resigned that position to take the governorship , reads as follows : 
 " the organizers of the federal international banking company feel that foreign investments are in the nature of alliances .... the federal international banking company will provide a new source of supply from which american demand for foreign investments may be satisfied .... it is intended to promote the expansion of american foreign trade .... investments in the federal international banking are intended to be self - liquidating .... it will be put to sound protective uses a part of the surplus capital of our nation . "
" ... its operations can be widely distributed in foreign countries and various industries . "
" ... that we must aid foreign debtors to purchase our products , rehabilitate themselves , expand and develop , and earn money with which to liquidate their debts , that foreign loans should be facilitated to aid the export sale of american products . "
now i 'll ask you if any more vivid statement of the policies which i have just pronounced to you was ever made than that .
throughout this prospectus constant reference is made to the fact that it is organized under the law , and the impression is given that in consequence it has some sort of official blessing from the federal government , including quotations from myself .
i have no reason to believe , i do not believe , that the governor 's enterprise on this occasion was not perfectly proper and was soundly rounded .
i do not wish to convey any such an impression .
but the governor as a private promoter for profit during the boom of 1928 believed and practiced what the governor , a presidential candidate , now denounces immoral and a cause of our calamities .
two weeks ago at cleveland i felt it was necessary to denounce certain calumnies being circulated in this campaign by the democratic national committee in official instructions to their campaign speakers .
that committee privately acknowledged that these have not a shred of foundation , and yet they refuse to take the manly course and withdraw those statements .
they have sought to maintain their continuing poison by silence .
i now have before me other calumnies of the democratic national committee , circulated in the same fashion by instructions to their campaign speakers .
these instructions bristle with titles such as these - and these questions will interest american women -- they are entitled : 
 " how president hoover has failed children . "
" his real interest in the nation 's children may be gained by his re - corded effort to emasculate and disrupt the children 's bureau . "
" the bunk of the home loan bank . "
governor roosevelt implies his endorsement of these calumnies by repeating these implications in his speeches when he speaks of what he calls " ... attempts that have been made to cut appropriations for child welfare . "
and again when he states that : " the united states public health service has said that over 6 million of our public school children have not enough to eat ; many of them are fainting at their desks ; they are the prey of disease ; and their future health is menaced . "
in another speech he uttered a slur on the home loan banking system created by this administration largely through the leadership of your senator .
these things have importance only as indicating the desperate attempts to mislead the american voter .
no woman in the united states believes that i am called upon to defend my interest in children over the past score of years .
but more to the point of this discussion , i have a letter from the chief of the united states public health service to the effect that no such statement as that quoted by governor roosevelt has ever been put out by him or by that service .
furthermore , i have an address , only a week old , by the president of the american public health association , who is not a government official , saying that " by and large , the health oњ the people as measured in sickness and in death has never been better in the history of the united states despite this depression . "
that shows the devoted work of thousands of american women and men whom his statements in this campaign sought to slur .
as to the children 's bureau , i may demonstrate the untruth of that statement by the fact that the first year of my administration , despite hard times , i increased the appropriations of that bureau from $ 320,000 to $ 368,000 , which was every cent the bureau asked for , and in the second year i recommended appropriations of $ 399,000 , which was every cent they said they could advantageously spend , and in the third year i recommended appropriations of $ 395,000 , but the democratic house of representatives reduced this by $ 20,000 .
that scarcely looks like an attempt to ruin the children 's bureau -- especially on my part .
in the matter of the home loan banks , the governor states that this idea was brought out in the middle of the campaign , and , like the instructions to speakers sent out by the democratic national committee he makes slurs upon it .
that statement falls a little to the ground in the same slough of untruth as the others when it is recollected that i rounded the better homes movement in the united states more than 10 years ago , whose activities in over 9,000 different communities through the devoted service of thousands of american women finally blossomed into the white house conference on home building and home ownership more than a year ago .
on that occasion i proposed and secured the backing of the men and women of the united states for the plan which ultimately resulted in the home loan banks .
and that bill was drafted and presented to congress in december last .
the refusal of the democratic house of representatives to act prevented its passage until the last hour of the session 8 months later and then only when the pressures from the women and the men devoted to the upbuilding of the american home had become so great that they dare not defeat it in the face of this political campaign .
had that bill been passed when it was introduced , nearly a year ago , the suffering and losses of thousands of small homeowners in the united states would have been prevented .
i consider that that act was the greatest act yet undertaken by any government at any time on behalf of thousands of owners of small homes .
it provides the machinery , through the mobilization of building and loan associations and savings bank , by which we may assure to men and women the opportunity to bring up their children in the surroundings which make for true unity and true purpose in american life .
now , in conclusion , in governor roosevelt 's address delivered on october 25 , he stated : 
 " after march 4 , 1929 , the republican party was in complete control of all branches of the government -- executive , senate , and house , and i may add , for good measure . . .
the supreme court as well . "
i invite your attention to that statement about the supreme court .
there are many things revealed in this campaign by our opponents which should give american citizens concern for the future .
one of the gravest is the state of mind revealed by my opponent in that statement .
he implies that it is the function of a party in power to control the supreme court .
for generations the republican and democratic presidents alike have made it their most sacred duty to respect and maintain the independence of america 's greatest tribunal .
president taft appointed a democratic chief justice ; president harding mated a democratic justice ; my last appointment was a democrat from the state of new york whose appointment was applauded by republicans and democrats alike the nation over .
all appointees of the supreme court have been chosen solely on the basis of their character and their mental power .
not since the civil war have the members of that court divided on political lines .
aside from the fact that the charge that the supreme court has been controlled by any political party is an atrocious one , there is a deeper implication in that statement .
does it disclose the democratic candidate 's conception of the functions of the supreme court ?
does he expect the supreme court to be subservient to him and his party ?
does that statement express his intention by his appointments or otherwise to attempt to reduce that tribunal to an instrument of party policy and political action for sustaining such doctrines as he may bring with him ?
my countrymen , i repeat to you , the fundamental issue of this campaign , the decision that will fix the national direction for a hundred years to come , is whether we shall go on in fidelity to american traditions or whether we shall turn to innovations , the spirit of which is disclosed to us by many sinister revelations and veiled promises .
my friends , i wish to make my position clear .
i propose to go on in the faith and loyalty to the traditions of our race .
i propose to build upon the foundations which our fathers have laid over this last 150 years .
to the senate and house of representatives : 
 in accord with my constitutional duty , i transmit herewith to the congress information upon the state of the union together with recommendation of measures for its consideration .
our country is at peace .
our national defense has been maintained at a high state of effectiveness .
all of the executive departments of the government have been conducted during the year with a high devotion to public interest .
there has been a far larger degree of freedom from industrial conflict than hitherto known .
education and science have made further advances .
the public health is to - day at its highest known level .
while we have recently engaged in the aggressive contest of a national election , its very tranquillity and the acceptance of its results furnish abundant proof of the strength of our institutions .
in the face of widespread hardship our people have demonstrated daily a magnificent sense of humanity , of individual and community responsibility for the welfare of the less fortunate .
they have grown in their conceptions and organization for cooperative action for the common welfare .
in the provision against distress during this winter , the great private agencies of the country have been mobilized again ; the generosity of our people has again come into evidence to a degree in which all america may take great pride .
likewise the local authorities and the states are engaged everywhere in supplemental measures of relief .
the provisions made for loans from the reconstruction finance corporation , to states that have exhausted their own resources , guarantee that there should be no hunger or suffering from cold in the country .
the large majority of states are showing a sturdy cooperation in the spirit of the federal aid .
the surgeon general , in charge of the public health service , furnishes me with the following information upon the state of public health : 
 mortality rate per 1,000 of population on an annual basis from representative states

 1931 11.2 60.0 
 1932 10.6 55.0 
 the sickness rates from data available show the same trends .
these facts indicate the fine endeavor of the agencies which have been mobilized for care of those in distress .
economic situation 
 the unparalleled world - wide economic depression has continued through the year .
due to the european collapse , the situation developed during last fall and winter into a series of most acute crises .
the unprecedented emergency measures enacted and policies adopted undoubtedly saved the country from economic disaster .
after serving to defend the national security , these measures began in july to show their weight and influence toward improvement of conditions in many parts of the country .
the following tables of current business indicators show the general economic movement during the past eleven months .

 the measures and policies which have procured this turn toward recovery should be continued until the depression is passed , and then the emergency agencies should be promptly liquidated .
the expansion of credit facilities by the federal reserve system and the reconstruction finance corporation has been of incalculable value .
the loans of the latter for reproductive works , and to railways for the creation of employment ; its support of the credit structure through loans to banks , insurance companies , railways , building and loan associations , and to agriculture has protected the savings and insurance policies of millions of our citizens and has relieved millions of borrowers from duress ; they have enabled industry and business to function and expand .
the assistance given to farm loan banks , the establishment of the home loan banks and agricultural credit associations -- all in their various ramifications have placed large sums of money at the disposal of the people in protection and aid .
beyond this , the extensive organization of the country in voluntary action has produced profound results .
the following table indicates direct expenditures of the federal government in aid to unemployment , agriculture , and financial relief over the past four years .
the sums applied to financial relief multiply themselves many fold , being in considerable measure the initial capital supplied to the reconstruction finance corporation , farm loan banks , etc . ,
which will be recovered to the treasury .

continued constructive policies promoting the economic recovery of the country must be the paramount duty of the government .
the result of the agencies we have created and the policies we have pursued has been to buttress our whole domestic financial structure and greatly to restore credit facilities .
but progress in recovery requires another element as well -- that is fully restored confidence in the future .
institutions and men may have resources and credit but unless they have confidence progress is halting and insecure .
there are three definite directions in which action by the government at once can contribute to strengthen further the forces of recovery by strengthening of confidence .
they are the necessary foundations to any other action , and their accomplishment would at once promote employment and increase prices .
the first of these directions of action is the continuing reduction of all government expenditures , whether national , state , or local .
the difficulties of the country demand undiminished efforts toward economy in government in every direction .
embraced in this problem is the unquestioned balancing of the federal budget .
that is the first necessity of national stability and is the foundation of further recovery .
it must be balanced in an absolutely safe and sure manner if full confidence is to be inspired .
the second direction for action is the complete reorganization at once of our banking system .
the shocks to our economic life have undoubtedly been multiplied by the weakness of this system , and until they are remedied recovery will be greatly hampered .
the third direction for immediate action is vigorous and whole souled cooperation with other governments in the economic field .
that our major difficulties find their origins in the economic weakness of foreign nations requires no demonstration .
the first need to - day is strengthening of commodity prices .
that can not be permanently accomplished by artificialities .
it must be accomplished by expansion in consumption of goods through the return of stability and confidence in the world at large and that in turn can not be fully accomplished without cooperation with other nations .
balancing the budget 
 i shall in due course present the executive budget to the congress .
it will show proposed reductions in appropriations below those enacted by the last session of the congress by over $ 830,000,000 .
in addition i shall present the necessary executive orders under the recent act authorizing the reorganization of the federal government which , if permitted to go into force , will produce still further substantial economies .
these sums in reduction of appropriations will , however , be partially offset by an increase of about $ 250,000,000 in uncontrollable items such as increased debt services , etc .
in the budget there is included only the completion of the federal public works projects already undertaken or under contract .
speeding up of federal public works during the past four years as an aid to employment has advanced many types of such improvements to the point where further expansion can not be justified in their usefulness to the government or the people .
as an aid to unemployment we should beyond the normal constructive programs substitute reproductive or so - called self - liquidating works .
loans for such purposes have been provided for through the reconstruction finance corporation .
this change in character of projects directly relieves the taxpayer and is capable of expansion into a larger field than the direct federal works .
the reproductive works constitute an addition to national wealth and to future employment , whereas further undue expansion of federal public works is but a burden upon the future .
the federal construction program thus limited to commitments and work in progress under the proposed appropriations contemplates expenditures for the next fiscal year , including naval and other vessel construction , as well as other forms of public works and maintenance , of a total of $ 442,769,000 , as compared with $ 717,262,000 for the present year .
the expenditure on such items over the four years ending june 30 next will amount to $ 2,350,000,000 , or an amount of construction work eight times as great as the cost of the panama canal and , except for completion of certain long - view projects , places the nation in many directions well ahead of its requirements for some years to come .
a normal program of about $ 200,000,000 per annum should hereafter provide for the country 's necessities and will permit substantial future reduction in federal expenditures .
i recommend that the furlough system installed last year be continued not only because of the economy produced but because , being tantamount to the " 5-day week , " it sets an example which should be followed by the country and because it embraces within its workings the " spread work " principle and thus serves to maintain a number of public servants who would otherwise be deprived of all income .
i feel , however , in view of the present economic situation and the decrease in the cost of living by over 20 per cent , that some further sacrifice should be made by salaried officials of the government over and above the 8 1/3 per cent reduction under the furlough system .
i will recommend that after exempting the first $ 1,000 of salary there should be a temporary reduction for one year of 11 per cent of that part of all government salaries in excess of the $ 1,000 exemption , the result of which , combined with the furlough system , will average about 14.8 per cent reduction in pay to those earning more than $ 1,000 .
i will recommend measures to eliminate certain payments in the veterans ' services .
i conceive these outlays were entirely beyond the original intentions of congress in building up veterans ' allowances .
many abuses have grown up from ill - considered legislation .
they should be eliminated .
the nation should not ask for a reduction in allowances to men and dependents whose disabilities rise out of war service nor to those veterans with substantial service who have become totally disabled from non - war - connected causes and who are at the same time without other support .
these latter veterans are a charge on the community at some point , and i feel that in view of their service to the nation as a whole the responsibility should fall upon the federal government .
many of the economies recommended in the budget were presented at the last session of the congress but failed of adoption .
if the economy and appropriations committees of the congress in canvassing these proposed expenditures shall find further reductions which can be made without impairing essential government services , it will be welcomed both by the country and by myself .
but under no circumstances do i feel that the congress should fail to uphold the total of reductions recommended .
some of the older revenues and some of the revenues provided under the act passed during the last session of the congress , particularly those generally referred to as the nuisance taxes , have not been as prolific of income as had been hoped .
further revenue is necessary in addition to the amount of reductions in expenditures recommended .
many of the manufacturers ' excise taxes upon selected industries not only failed to produce satisfactory revenue , but they are in many ways unjust and discriminatory .
the time has come when , if the government is to have an adequate basis of revenue to assure a balanced budget , this system of special manufacturers ' excise taxes should be extended to cover practically all manufactures at a uniform rate , except necessary food and possibly some grades of clothing .
at the last session the congress responded to my request for authority to reorganize the government departments .
the act provides for the grouping and consolidation of executive and administrative agencies according to major purpose , and thereby reducing the number and overlap and duplication of effort .
executive orders issued for these purposes are required to be transmitted to the congress while in session and do not become effective until after the expiration of 60 calendar days after such transmission , unless the congress shall sooner approve .
i shall issue such executive orders within a few days grouping or consolidating over fifty executive and administrative agencies including a large number of commissions and " independent " agencies .
the second step , of course , remains that after these various bureaus and agencies are placed cheek by jowl into such groups , the administrative officers in charge of the groups shall eliminate their overlap and still further consolidate these activities .
therein lie large economies .
the congress must be warned that a host of interested persons inside and outside the government whose vision is concentrated on some particular function will at once protest against these proposals .
these same sorts of activities have prevented reorganization of the government for over a quarter of a century .
they must be disregarded if the task is to be accomplished .
banking 
 the basis of every other and every further effort toward recovery is to reorganize at once our banking system .
the shocks to our economic system have undoubtedly multiplied by the weakness of our financial system .
i first called attention of the congress in 1929 to this condition , and i have unceasingly recommended remedy since that time .
the subject has been exhaustively investigated both by the committees of the congress and the officers of the federal reserve system .
the banking and financial system is presumed to serve in furnishing the essential lubricant to the wheels of industry , agriculture , and commerce , that is , credit .
its diversion from proper use , its improper use , or its insufficiency instantly brings hardship and dislocation in economic life .
as a system our banking has failed to meet this great emergency .
it can be said without question of doubt that our losses and distress have been greatly augmented by its wholly inadequate organization .
its inability as a system to respond to our needs is to - day a constant drain upon progress toward recovery .
in this statement i am not referring to individual banks or bankers .
thousands of them have shown distinguished courage and ability .
on the contrary , i am referring to the system itself , which is so organized , or so lacking in organization , that in an emergency its very mechanism jeopardizes or paralyzes the action of sound banks and its instability is responsible for periodic dangers to our whole economic system .
bank failures rose in 1931 to 10 1/2 per cent of all the banks as compared to 1 1/2 per cent of the failures of all other types of enterprise .
since january 1 , 1930 , we have had 4,665 banks suspend , with $ 3,300,000,000 in deposits .
partly from fears and drains from abroad , partly from these failures themselves ( which indeed often caused closing of sound banks ) , we have witnessed hoarding of currency to an enormous sum , rising during the height of the crisis to over $ 1,600,000,000 .
the results from interreaction of cause and effect have expressed themselves in strangulation of credit which at times has almost stifled the nation 's business and agriculture .
the losses , suffering , and tragedies of our people are incalculable .
not alone do they lie in the losses of savings to millions of homes , injury by deprival of working capital to thousands of small businesses , but also , in the frantic pressure to recall loans to meet pressures of hoarding and in liquidation of failed banks , millions of other people have suffered in the loss of their homes and farms , businesses have been ruined , unemployment increased , and farmers ' prices diminished .
that this failure to function is unnecessary and is the fault of our particular system is plainly indicated by the fact that in great britain , where the economic mechanism has suffered far greater shocks than our own , there has not been a single bank failure during the depression .
again in canada , where the situation has been in large degree identical with our own , there have not been substantial bank failures .
the creation of the reconstruction finance corporation and the amendments to the federal reserve act served to defend the nation in a great crisis .
they are not remedies ; they are relief .
it is inconceivable that the reconstruction corporation , which has extended aid to nearly 6,000 institutions and is manifestly but a temporary device , can go on indefinitely .
it is to - day a matter of satisfaction that the rate of bank failures , of hoarding , and the demands upon the reconstruction corporation have greatly lessened .
the acute phases of the crisis have obviously passed and the time has now come when this national danger and this failure to respond to national necessities must be ended and the measures to end them can be safely undertaken .
methods of reform have been exhaustively examined .
there is no reason now why solution should not be found at the present session of the congress .
inflation of currency or governmental conduct of banking can have no part in these reforms .
the government must abide within the field of constructive organization , regulation , and the enforcement of safe practices only .
parallel with reform in the banking laws must be changes in the federal farm loan banking system and in the joint stock land banks .
some of these changes should be directed to permanent improvement and some to emergency aid to our people where they wish to fight to save their farms and homes .
i wish again to emphasize this view -- that these widespread banking reforms are a national necessity and are the first requisites for further recovery in agriculture and business .
they should have immediate consideration as steps greatly needed to further recovery .
economic cooperation with other nations 
 our major difficulties during the past two years find their origins in the shocks from economic collapse abroad which in turn are the aftermath of the great war .
if we are to secure rapid and assured recovery and protection for the future we must cooperate with foreign nations in many measures .
we have actively engaged in a world disarmament conference where , with success , we should reduce our own tax burdens and the tax burdens of other major nations .
we should increase political stability of the world .
we should lessen the danger of war by increasing defensive powers and decreasing offensive powers of nations .
we would thus open new vistas of economic expansion for the world .
we are participating in the formulation of a world economic conference , successful results from which would contribute much to advance in agricultural prices , employment , and business .
currency depreciation and correlated forces have contributed greatly to decrease in price levels .
moreover , from these origins rise most of the destructive trade barriers now stifling the commerce of the world .
we could by successful action increase security and expand trade through stability in international exchange and monetary values .
by such action world confidence could be restored .
it would bring courage and stability , which will reflect into every home in our land .
the european governments , obligated to us in war debts , have requested that there should be suspension of payments due the united states on december 15 next , to be accompanied by exchange of views upon this debt question .
our government has informed them that we do not approve of suspension of the december 15 payments .
i have stated that i would recommend to the congress methods to overcome temporary exchange difficulties in connection with this payment from nations where it may be necessary .
in the meantime i wish to reiterate that here are three great fields of international action which must be considered not in part but as a whole .
they are of most vital interest to our people .
within them there are not only grave dangers if we fail in right action but there also tie immense opportunities for good if we shall succeed .
within success there lie major remedies for our economic distress and major progress in stability and security to every fireside in our country .
the welfare of our people is dependent upon successful issue of the great causes of world peace , world disarmament , and organized world recovery .
nor is it too much to say that to - day as never before the welfare of mankind and the preservation of civilization depend upon our solution of these questions .
such solutions can not be attained except by honest friendship , by adherence to agreements entered upon until mutually revised and by cooperation amongst nations in a determination to find solutions which will be mutually beneficial .
other legislation 
 i have placed various legislative needs before the congress in previous messages , and these views require no amplification on this occasion .
i have urged the need for reform in our transportation and power regulation , in the antitrust laws as applied to our national resource industries , western range conservation , extension of federal aid to child health services , membership in the world court , the ratification of the great lakes - st .
lawrence seaway treaty , revision of the bankruptcy acts , revision of federal court procedure , and many other pressing problems .
these and other special subjects i shall where necessary deal with by special communications to the congress .
the activities of our government are so great , when combined with the emergency activities which have arisen out of the world crisis , that even the briefest review of them would render the annual message unduly long .
i shall therefore avail myself of the fact that every detail of the government is covered in the reports to the congress by each of the departments and agencies of the government .
conclusion 
 it seems to me appropriate upon this occasion to make certain general observations upon the principles which must dominate the solution of problems now pressing upon the nation .
legislation in response to national needs will be effective only if every such act conforms to a complete philosophy of the people 's purposes and destiny .
ours is a distinctive government with a unique history and background , consciously dedicated to specific ideals of liberty and to a faith in the inviolable sanctity of the individual human spirit .
furthermore , the continued existence and adequate functioning of our government in preservation of ordered liberty and stimulation of progress depends upon the maintenance of state , local , institutional , and individual sense of responsibility .
we have builded a system of individualism peculiarly our own which must not be forgotten in any governmental acts , for from it have grown greater accomplishments than those of any other nation .
on the social and economic sides , the background of our american system and the motivation of progress is essentially that we should allow free play of social and economic forces as far as will not limit equality of opportunity and as will at the same time stimulate the initiative and enterprise of our people .
in the maintenance of this balance the federal government can permit of no privilege to any person or group .
it should act as a regulatory agent and not as a participant in economic and social life .
the moment the government participates , it becomes a competitor with the people .
as a competitor it becomes at once a tyranny in whatever direction it may touch .
we have around us numerous such experiences , no one of which can be found to have justified itself except in cases where the people as a whole have met forces beyond their control , such as those of the great war and this great depression , where the full powers of the federal government must be exerted to protect the people .
but even these must be limited to an emergency sense and must be promptly ended when these dangers are overcome .
with the free development of science and the consequent multitude of inventions , some of which are absolutely revolutionary in our national life , the government must not only stimulate the social and economic responsibility of individuals and private institutions but it must also give leadership to cooperative action amongst the people which will soften the effect of these revolutions and thus secure social transformations in an orderly manner .
the highest form of self - government is the voluntary cooperation within our people for such purposes .
but i would emphasize again that social and economic solutions , as such , will not avail to satisfy the aspirations of the people unless they conform with the traditions of our race deeply grooved in their sentiments through a century and a half of struggle for ideals of life that are rooted in religion and fed from purely spiritual springs .

to the house of representatives : 
 i return herewith , without my approval , h. r. 17054 , " an act to increase the loan basis of adjusted service certificates . "
in order that it may be clearly understood , i may review that the adjusted compensation act ( bonus bill ) passed on may 19 , 1924 , awarded to 3,498,000 veterans approximately $ 1,365,000,000 further compensation for war service .
to this sum was added 25 per cent , said to be consideration for deferring the payment until about 1945 , the whole bearing 4 per cent compound interest .
immediate payment to dependents upon death was included , thus creating an endowment insurance policy represented by a certificate to each veteran showing the sum payable at the end of the period -- the " face value . "
the total " face value " of the outstanding certificates to - day after paying the sums due of less than $ 50 and payments in full to dependents is $ 3,426,000,000 held by 3,397,000 veterans or an average of about $ 1,000 each .
the burden upon the country was to be an amount each year sufficient as a yearly premium to provide for the payment of the " face value " of these certificates in about 1945 , and to date has involved an appropriation averaging $ 112,000,000 per annum .
the accumulation of these appropriations is represented by government obligations deposited in a reserve fund , which fund now amounts to about $ 750,000,000 .
a loan basis to certificate holders was established equal to 90 per cent of the reserve value of the certificates , such loans now in the sixth year being authorized to 221/2 per cent of the " face value . "
when the bonus act was passed it was upon the explicit understanding of the congress that the matter was closed and the government would not be called upon to make subsequent enlargements .
it is now proposed to enlarge the loan rate to 50 per cent of the " face value , " at a low rate of interest , thus imposing a potential cash outlay upon the government of about $ 1,700,000,000 , if all veterans apply for loans , less about $ 330,000,000 already loaned .
according to the administrator of veterans ' affairs the probable number who will avail themselves of the privilege under this bill will require approximately $ 1,000,000,000 .
there not being a penny in the treasury to meet such a demand , the government must borrow this sum through the sale of the reserve fund securities together with further issues or we must need impose further taxation .
the sole appeal made for the reopening of the bonus act is the claim that funds from the national treasury should be provided to veterans in distress as the result of the drought and business depression .
there are veterans unemployed and in need to - day in common with many others of our people .
these , like the others , are being provided the basic necessities of life by the devoted committees in those parts of the country affected by the depression or drought .
the governments and many employers are giving preference to veterans in employment .
their welfare is and should be a matter of concern to our people .
inquiry indicates that such care is being given throughout the country , and it also indicates that the number of veterans in need of such relief is a minor percentage of the whole .
the utility of this legislation as relief to those in distress is far less than has been disclosed .
the popular assumption has been that as the certificates average $ 1,000 then each veteran can obtain $ 500 by way of a loan .
but this is only an average , and more than one - half will receive less than this amount .
in fact over 800,000 men will be able to borrow less than $ 200 , and of these over 200,000 will be able to borrow only an average of $ 75 .
furthermore , there are 100,000 veterans whose certificates have been issued recently who under the proposed law will have no loan privilege until their certificates are two years old .
it is therefore urgent in any event that local committees continue relief to veterans , but this legislation would lead such local committees and employers to assume that these veterans have been provided for by the federal treasury , and thereby threatens them with greater hardships than before .
the breach of fundamental principle in this proposal is the requirement of the federal government to provide an enormous sum of money to a vast majority who are able to care for themselves and who are caring for themselves .
among those who would receive the proposed benefits are included 387,000 veterans and 400,000 dependents , who are already receiving some degree of allowance or support from the federal government .
but in addition to these , it provides equal benefits for scores of thousands of others who are in the income - tax paying class , and for scores of thousands who are holding secure positions in the federal , state , and local governments and in every profession and industry .
i know that most of these men do not seek these privileges , they have no desire to be presented to the american people as benefitting by a burden put upon the whole people , and i have many manifestations from veterans on whom the times are bearing hardly that they do not want to be represented to our people as a group substituting special privilege for the idealism and patriotism they have rejoiced in offering to their country through their service .
it is suggested as a reason for making these provisions applicable to all veterans , that we should not make public distinction between veterans in need and the others who comprise the vast majority lest we characterize those deserving help as a pauper class .
on the contrary , veterans in need are and should be a preferred class , that a grateful country would be proud to honor with its support .
adoption of the principle of aid to the rich or to those able to support themselves in itself sets up a group of special privilege among our citizens .
the principle that the nation should give generous care to those veterans who are ill , disabled , in need or in distress , even though these disabilities do not arise from the war , has been fully accepted by the nation .
pensions or allowances have been provided for the dependents of those who lost their lives in the war ; allowances have been provided to those who suffered disabilities from the war ; additional allowances were passed at the last session of congress to all the veterans whose earning power at any time may be permanently impaired by injury or illness ; free hospitalization is available not only to those suffering from the results of war but to large numbers of temporarily ill .
together with war - risk insurance and the adjusted compensation , these services now total an annual expenditure of approximately $ 600,000,000 and under existing laws will increase to $ 800,000,000 per annum in a very few years for world war veterans alone .
a total of five thousand millions of dollars has been expended upon such services since the war .
our country has thus shown its sense of obligation and generosity , and its readiness at all times to aid those of its veterans in need .
i have the utmost confidence that our service men would be amongst the first to oppose a policy of government assistance to veterans who have property and means to support themselves , for service men are as devoted to the welfare of our country in peace as in war and as clearly foresee the future dangers of embarking on such a policy .
it could but create resentments which would ultimately react against those who should be given care .
it is argued that the distribution of the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed by this bill would stimulate business generally .
we can not further the restoration of prosperity by borrowing from some of our people , pledging the credit of all of the people , to loan to some of our people who are not in need of the money .
if the exercise of these rights were limited to expenditure upon necessities only , there would be no stimulation to business .
the theory of stimulation is based upon the anticipation of wasteful expenditure .
it can be of no assistance in the return of real prosperity .
if this argument of proponents is correct , we should make government loans to the whole people .
it is represented that this measure merely provides loans against a future obligation and that , therefore , it will cost the american people nothing .
that is an incomplete statement .
a cost at once arises to the people when instead of proceeding by annual appropriation the government is forced to secure a huge sum by borrowing or otherwise , especially in the circumstances of to - day when we are compelled in the midst of depression to make other large borrowings to cover deficits and refunding operations .
an increased rate of interest which the government must pay upon all long - term issues is inevitable .
it imposes an additional burden of interest on the people which will extend through the whole term of such loans .
some cost arises to the people through the tendency to increase the interest rates which every state and municipality must pay in their borrowing for public works and improvements , as well as the rate which industry and business must pay .
there is a cost to someone through the retardation of the speed of recovery of employment when government borrowings divert the savings of the people from their use by constructive industry and commerce .
it imposes a great charge upon the individual who loses such increased employment or continues unemployed .
to the veteran this is a double loss when he has consumed the value of his certificate and has also lost the opportunity for greater earnings .
there is a greater cost than all this : it is a step toward government aid to those who can help themselves .
these direct or indirect burdens fall upon the people as a whole .
the need of our people to - day is a decrease in the burden of taxes and unemployment , yet they ( who include the veterans ) are being steadily forced toward higher tax levels and lessened employment by such acts as this .
we must not forget the millions of hard - working families in our country who are striving to pay the debts which they have incurred in acquiring homes and farms in endeavor to build protection for their future .
they , in the last analysis , must bear the burden of increasing government aid and taxes .
it is not the rich who suffer .
when we take employment and taxes from our people it is the poor who suffer .
there is a very serious phase of this matter for the wives and children of veterans and to the future security of veterans themselves .
each of these certificates is an endowment insurance policy .
any moneys advanced against them , together with its interest , will be automatically deducted from the value of the certificates in case of death or upon maturity .
no one will deny that under the pressures or allurements of the moment , many will borrow against these certificates for other than absolutely necessary purposes .
the loss to many families means the destruction of the one safeguard at their most critical time .
it can not be contended that the interests of the families of our country are conserved by either cashing or borrowing upon their life - insurance policies .
i have no desire to present monetary aspects of the question except so far as they affect the human aspects .
surely it is a human aspect to transfer to the backs of those who toil , including veterans , a burden of those who by position and property can care for themselves .
it is a human aspect to incur the danger of continued or increased unemployment .
it is a human aspect to deprive women and children of protection by reckless use of an endowment policy .
our country is rich enough to do any justice .
no country is rich enough to do an injustice .
the patriotism of our people is not a material thing .
it is a spiritual thing .
we can not pay for it with government aid .
we can honor those in need by our aid .
and it is a fundamental aspect of freedom among us that no step should be taken which burdens the nation with a privileged class who can care for themselves .
i regard the bill under consideration as unwise from the standpoint of the veterans themselves , and unwise from the standpoint of the welfare of all the people .
the future of our world war veterans is inseparably bound up with the future of the whole people .
the greatest service that we can render both veterans and the public generally is to administer the affairs of our government with a view to the well - being and happiness of all of the nation .
the matter under consideration is of grave importance in itself ; but of much graver importance is the whole tendency to open the federal treasury to a thousand purposes , many admirable in their intentions but in which the proponents fail or do not care to see that with such beginnings many of them insidiously consume more and more of the savings and the labor of our people .
in aggregate they threaten burdens beyond the ability of our country normally to bear ; and , of far higher importance , each of them breaks the barriers of self - reliance and self - support in our people .

this campaign now draws near a close .
the platforms of the two parties defining principles and offering solutions of various national problems have been presented and are being earnestly considered by our people .
after four months ' debate it is not the republican party which finds reason for abandonment of any of the principles it has laid down , or of the views it has expressed for solution of the problems before the country .
the principles to which it adheres are rooted deeply in the foundations of our national life .
the solutions which it proposes are based on experience with government and on a consciousness that it may have the responsibility for placing those solutions in action .
in my acceptance speech i endeavored to outline the spirit and ideals by which i would be guided in carrying that platform into administration .
tonight , i will not deal with the multitude of issues which have been already well canvassed .
i intend rather to discuss some of those more fundamental principles and ideals upon which i believe the government of the united states should be conducted .
the republican party has ever been a party of progress .
i do not need to review its seventy years of constructive history .
it has always reflected the spirit of the american people .
never has it done more for the advancement of fundamental progress than during the past seven and a half years since we took over the government amidst the ruin left by war .
it detracts nothing from the character and energy of the american people , it minimizes in no degree the quality of their accomplishments to say that the policies of the republican party have played a large part in recuperation from the war and the building of the magnificent progress which shows upon every hand today .
i say with emphasis that without the wise policies which the republican party has brought into action during this period , no such progress would have been possible .
the first responsibility of the republican administration was to renew the march of progress from its collapse by the war .
that task involved the restoration of confidence in the future and the liberation and stimulation of the constructive energies of our people .
it discharged that task .
there is not a person within the sound of my voice that does not know the profound progress which our country has made in this period .
every man and woman knows that american comfort , hope and confidence for the future are immeasurably higher this day than they were seven and one - half years ago .
it is not my purpose to enter upon a detailed recital of the great constructive measures of the past seven and a half years by which this has been brought about .
it is sufficient to remind you of the restoration of employment to the millions who walked your streets in idleness ; to remind you of the creation of the budget system ; the reduction of six billions of national debt which gave the powerful impulse of that vast sum returned to industry and commerce ; the four sequent reductions of taxes and thereby the lift to the living of every family ; the enactment of adequate protective tariff and immigration laws which have safeguarded our workers and farmers from floods of goods and labor from foreign countries ; the creation of credit facilities and many other aids to agriculture ; the building up of foreign trade ; the care of veterans ; the development of aviation , of radio , of our inland waterways , of our highways ; the expansion of scientific research , of welfare activities , the making of safer highways , safer mines , better homes ; the spread of outdoor recreation ; the improvement in public health and the care of children ; and a score of other progressive actions .
nor do i need to remind you that government today deals with an economic and social system vastly more intricate and delicately adjusted than ever before .
that system now must be kept in perfect tune if we would maintain uninterrupted employment and the high standards of living of our people .
the government has come to touch this delicate web at a thousand points .
yearly the relations of government to national prosperity become more and more intimate .
only through keen vision and helpful cooperation by the government has stability in business and stability in employment been maintained during this past seven and a half years .
there always are some localities , some industries and some individuals who do not share the prevailing prosperity .
the task of government is to lessen these inequalities .
never has there been a period when the federal government has given such aid and impulse to the progress of our people , not alone to economic progress but to the development of those agencies which make for moral and spiritual progress .
but in addition to this great record of contributions of the republican party to progress , there has been a further fundamental contribution -- a contribution underlying and sustaining all the others -- and that is the resistance of the republican party to every attempt to inject the government into business in competition with its citizens .
after the war , when the republican party assumed administration of the country , we were faced with the problem of determination of the very nature of our national life .
during 150 years we have builded up a form of self - government and a social system which is peculiarly our own .
it differs essentially from all others in the world .
it is the american system .
it is just as definite and positive a political and social system as has ever been developed on earth .
it is founded upon a particular conception of self - government ; in which decentralized local responsibility is the very base .
further than this , it is founded upon the conception that only through ordered liberty , freedom and equal opportunity to the individual will his initiative and enterprise spur on the march of progress .
and in our insistence upon equality of opportunity has our system advanced beyond all the world .
during the war we necessarily turned to the government to solve every difficult economic problem .
the government having absorbed every energy of our people for war , there was no other solution .
for the preservation of the state , the federal government became a centralized despotism which undertook unprecedented responsibilities , assumed autocratic powers , and took over the business of citizens .
to a large degree we regimented our whole people temporarily into a socialistic state .
however justified in time of war , if continued in peace time it would destroy not only our american system but with it our progress and freedom as well .
when the war closed , the most vital of all issues both in our own country and throughout the world was whether governments should continue their wartime ownership and operation of many instrumentalities of production and distribution .
we were challenged with a peace - time choice between the american system of rugged individualism and a european philosophy of diametrically opposed doctrines -- doctrines of paternalism and state socialism .
the acceptance of these ideas would have meant the destruction of self - government through centralization of government .
it would have meant the undermining of the individual initiative and enterprise through which our people have grown to unparalleled greatness .
the republican party from the beginning resolutely turned its face away from these ideas and these war practices .
a republican congress cooperated with the democratic administration to demobilize many of our war activities .
at that time the two parties were accord upon that point .
when the republican party came into full power , it went at once resolutely back to our fundamental conception of the state and the rights and responsibilities of the individual .
thereby it restored confidence and hope in the american people , it freed and stimulated enterprise , it restored the government to its position as an umpire instead of a player in the economic game .
for these reasons the american people have gone forward in progress while the rest of the world has halted , and some countries have even gone backwards .
if anyone will study the causes of retarded recuperation in europe , he will find much of it due to the stifling of private initiative on one hand , and overloading of the government with business on the other .
there has been revived in this campaign , however , a series of proposals which , if adopted , would be a long step toward the abandonment of our american system and a surrender to the destructive operation of governmental conduct of commercial business .
because the country is faced with difficulty and doubt over certain national problems -- that is , prohibition , farm relief and electrical power -- our opponents propose that we must thrust government a long way into the businesses which give rise to these problems .
in effect , they abandon the tenets of their own party and turn to state socialism as a solution for the difficulties presented by all three .
it is proposed that we shall change from prohibition to the state purchase and sale of liquor .
if their agricultural relief program means anything , it means that the government shall directly or indirectly buy and sell and fix prices of agricultural products .
and we are to go into the hydroelectric - power business .
in other words , we are confronted with a huge program of government in business .
there is , therefore , submitted to the american people a question of fundamental principle .
that is : shall we depart from the principles of our american political and economic system , upon which we have advanced beyond all the rest of the world , in order to adopt methods based on principles destructive of its very foundations ?
and i wish to emphasize the seriousness of these proposals .
i wish to make my position clear ; for this goes to the very roots of american life and progress .
i should like to state to you the effect that this projection of government in business would have upon our system of self - government and our economic system .
that effect would reach to the daily life of every man and woman .
it would impair the very basis of liberty and freedom not only for those left outside the fold of expanded bureaucracy but for those embraced within it .
let us first see the effect upon self - government .
when the federal government undertakes to go into commercial business , it must at once set up the organization and administration of that business , and it immediately finds itself in a labyrinth , every alley of which leads to the destruction of self - government .
commercial business requires a concentration of responsibility .
self - government requires decentralization and many checks and balances to safeguard liberty .
our government to succeed in business would need become in effect a despotism .
there at once begins the destruction of self - government .
the first problem of the government about to adventure in commercial business is to determine a method of administration .
it must secure leadership and direction .
shall this leadership be chosen by political agencies or shall we make it elective ?
the hard practical fact is that leadership in business must come through the sheer rise in ability and character .
that rise can only take place in the free atmosphere of competition .
competition is closed by bureaucracy .
political agencies are feeble channels through which to select able leaders to conduct commercial business .
government , in order to avoid the possible incompetence , corruption and tyranny of too great authority in individuals entrusted with commercial business , inevitably turns to boards and commissions .
to make sure that there are checks and balances , each member of such boards and commissions must have equal authority .
each has his separate responsibility to the public , and at once we have the conflict of ideas and the lack of decision which would ruin any commercial business .
it has contributed greatly to the demoralization of our shipping business .
moreover , these commissions must be representative of different sections and different political parties , so that at once we have an entire blight upon coordinated action within their ranks which destroys any possibility of effective administration .
moreover , our legislative bodies can not in fact delegate their full authority to commissions or to individuals for the conduct of matters vital to the american people ; for if we would preserve government by the people we must preserve the authority of our legislators in the activities of our government .
thus every time the federal government goes into a commercial business , 531 senators and congressmen become the actual board of directors of that business .
every time a state government goes into business , one or two hundred state senators and legislators become the actual directors of that business .
even if they were supermen and if there were no politics in the united states , no body of such numbers could competently direct commercial activities ; for that requires initiative , instant decision .
and action .
it took congress six years of constant discussion to even decide what the method of administration of muscle shoals should be .
when the federal government undertakes to go into business , the state governments are at once deprived of control and taxation of that business ; when a state government undertakes to go into business , it at once deprives the municipalities of taxation and control of that business .
municipalities , being local and close to the people , can , at times , succeed in business where federal and state governments must fail .
we have trouble enough with log rolling in legislative bodies today .
it originates naturally from desires of citizens to advance their particular section or to secure some necessary service .
it would be multiplied a thousandfold were the federal and state governments in these businesses .
the effect upon our economic progress would be even worse .
business progressiveness is dependent on competition .
new methods and new ideas are the outgrowth of the spirit of adventure , of individual initiative and of individual enterprise .
without adventure there is no progress .
no government administration can rightly take chances with taxpayers ' money .
there is no better example of the practical incompetence of government to conduct business than the history of our railways .
during the war , the government found it necessary to operate the railways .
that operation continued until after the war .
in the year before being freed from government operation , they were not able to meet the demands for transportation .
eight years later we find them under private enterprise transporting 15 per cent more goods and meeting every demand for service .
rates have been reduced by 15 per cent and net earnings increased from less than 1 per cent on their valuation to about 5 per cent .
wages of employees have improved by 13 per cent .
the wages of railway employees are today 121 per cent above pre - war , while the wages of government employees are today only 65 per cent above pre - war .
that should be a sufficient commentary upon the efficiency of government operation .
let us now examine this question from the point of view of the person who may get a government job and is admitted into the new bureaucracy .
upon that subject let me quote from a speech of that great leader of labor , samuel gompers , delivered in montreal in 1920 , a few years before his death .
he said:"i believe there is no man to whom i would take second position in my loyalty to the republic of the united states , and yet i would not give it more power over the individual citizenship of our country."it is a question of whether it shall be government ownership or private ownership under control .
if i were in the minority of one in this convention , i would want to cast my vote so that the men of labor shall not willingly enslave themselves to government authority in their industrial effort for freedom."let the future tell the story of who is right or who is wrong ; who has stood for freedom and who has been willing to submit their fate industrially to the government."i would amplify mr. gompers ' statement .
the great body of government employees which would be created by the proposals of our opponents would either comprise a political machine at the disposal of the party in power , or alternatively , to prevent this , the government by stringent civil - service rules must debar its employees from their full political rights as free men .
it must limit them in the liberty to bargain for their own wages , for no government employee can strike against his government and thus against the whole people .
it makes a legislative body with all its political currents their final employer and master .
their bargaining does not rest upon economic need or economic strength but on political potence .
but what of those who are outside the bureaucracy ?
what is the effect upon their lives?the area of enterprise and opportunity for them to strive and rise is at once limited .
the government in commercial business does not tolerate amongst its customers the freedom of competitive reprisals to which private business is subject .
bureaucracy does not tolerate the spirit of independence ; it spreads the spirit of submission into our daily life and penetrates the temper of our people not with the habit of powerful resistance to wrong but with the habit of timid acceptance of irresistible might .
bureaucracy is ever desirous of spreading its influence and its power .
you can not extend the mastery of the government over the daily working life of a people without at the same time making it the master of the people 's souls and thoughts .
every expansion of government in business means that government in order to protect itself from the political consequences of its errors and wrongs is driven irresistibly without peace to greater and greater control of the nations ' press and platform .
free speech does not live many hours after free industry and free commerce die .
it is a false liberalism that interprets itself into the government operation of commercial business .
every step of bureaucratizing of the business of our country poisons the very roots of liberalism -- that is , political equality , free speech , free assembly , free press , and equality of opportunity .
it is the road not to more liberty , but to less liberty .
liberalism should be found not striving to spread bureaucracy but striving to set bounds to it .
true liberalism seeks all legitimate freedom first in the confident belief that without such freedom the pursuit of all other blessings and benefits is vain .
that belief is the foundation of all american progress , political as well as economic .
liberalism is a force truly of the spirit , a force proceeding from the deep realization that economic freedom can not be sacrificed if political freedom is to be preserved , even if governmental conduct of business could give us more efficiency instead of less efficiency , the fundamental objection to it would remain unaltered and unabated .
it would destroy political equality .
it would increase rather than decrease abuse and corruption .
it would stifle initiative and invention .
it would undermine the development of leadership .
it would cramp and cripple the mental and spiritual energies of our people .
it would extinguish equality and opportunity .
it would dry up the spirit of liberty and progress .
for these reasons primarily it must be resisted .
for a hundred and fifty years liberalism has found its true spirit in the american system , not in the european systems .
i do not wish to be misunderstood in this statement .
i am defining a general policy .
it does not mean that our government is to part with one iota of its national resources without complete protection to the public interest .
i have already stated that where the government is engaged in public works for purposes of flood control , of navigation , of irrigation , of scientific research or national defense , or in pioneering a new art , it will at times necessarily produce power or commodities as a by - product .
but they must be a by - product of the major purpose , not the major purpose itself .
nor do i wish to be misinterpreted as believing that the united states is free - for - all and devil - take - the - hind - most .
the very essence of equality of opportunity and of american individualism is that there shall be no domination by any group or combination in this republic , whether it be business or political .
on the contrary , it demands economic justice as well as political and social justice .
it is no system of laissez faire .
i feel deeply on this subject because during the war i had some practical experience with governmental operation and control .
i have witnessed not only at home but abroad the many failures of government in business .
i have seen its tyrannies , its injustices , its destructions of self - government , its undermining of the very instincts which carry our people forward to progress .
i have witnessed the lack of advance , the lowered standards of living , the depressed spirits of people working under such a system .
my objection is based not upon theory or upon a failure to recognize wrong or abuse , but i know the adoption of such methods would strike at the very roots of american life and would destroy the very basis of american progress .
our people have the right to know whether we can continue to solve our great problems without abandonment of our american system .
i know we can .
we have demonstrated that our system is responsive enough to meet any new and intricate development in our economic and business life .
we have demonstrated that we can meet any economic problem and still maintain our democracy as master in its own house and that we can at the same time preserve equality of opportunity and individual freedom .
in the last fifty years we have discovered that mass production will produce articles for us at half the cost they required previously .
we have seen the resultant growth of large units of production and distribution .
this is big business .
many businesses must be bigger for our tools are bigger , our country is bigger .
we now build a single dynamo of a hundred thousand horsepower .
even fifteen years ago that would have been a big business all by itself .
yet today advance in production requires that we set ten of these units together in a row .
the american people from bitter experience have a rightful fear that great business units might be used to dominate our industrial life and by illegal and unethical practices destroy equality of opportunity .
years ago the republican administration established the principle that such evils could be corrected by regulation .
it developed methods by which abuses could be prevented while the full value of industrial progress could be retained for the public .
it insisted upon the principle that when great public utilities were clothed with the security of partial monopoly , whether it be railways , power plants , telephones or what not , then there must be the fullest and most complete control of rates , services , and finances by government or local agencies .
it declared that these businesses must be conducted with glass pockets .
as to our great manufacturing and distributing industries , the republican party insisted up on the enactment of laws that not only would maintain competition but would destroy conspiracies to destroy the smaller units or dominate and limit the equality of opportunity amongst our people .
one of the great problems of government is to determine to what extent the government shall regulate and control commerce and industry and how much it shall leave it alone .
no system is perfect .
we have had many abuses in the private conduct of business .
that every good citizen resents .
it is just as important that business keep out of government as that government keep out of business .
nor am i setting up the contention that our institutions are perfect .
no human ideal is ever perfectly attained , since humanity itself is not perfect .
the wisdom of our forefathers in their conception that progress can only be attained as the sum of the accomplishment of free individuals has been re - enforced by all of the great leaders of the country since that day .
jackson , lincoln , cleveland , mckinley , roosevelt , wilson , and coolidge have stood unalterably for these principles .
and what have been the results of our american system ?
our country has become the land of opportunity to those born without inheritance , not merely because of the wealth of its resources and industry but because of this freedom of initiative and enterprise .
russia has natural resources equal to ours .
her people are equally industrious , but she has not had the blessings of 150 years of our form of government and of our social system .
by adherence to the principles of decentralized self - government , ordered liberty , equal opportunity and freedom to the individual , our american experiment in human welfare has yielded a degree of well - being unparalleled in all the world .
it has come nearer to the abolition of poverty , to the abolition of fear of want , than humanity has ever reached before .
progress of the past seven years is the proof of it .
this alone furnishes the answer to our opponents who ask us to introduce destructive elements into the system by which this has been accomplished .
let us see what this system has done for us in our recent years of difficult and trying reconstruction and let us then solemnly ask ourselves if we now wish to abandon it .
as a nation we came out of the war with great losses .
we made no profits from it .
the apparent increases in wages were at that time fictitious .
we were poorer as a nation when we emerged from the war .
yet during these last eight years , we have recovered from these losses and increased our national income by over one - third even if we discount the inflation of the dollar .
that there has been a wide diffusion of our gain in wealth and income is marked by a hundred proofs .
i know of no better test of the improved conditions of the average family than the combined increase in assets of life and industrial insurance , building and loan associations , and savings deposits .
these are the savings banks of the average man .
these agencies alone have in seven years increased by nearly 100 per cent to the gigantic sum of over 50 billions of dollars , or nearly one - sixth of our whole national wealth .
we have increased in home ownership , we have expanded the investments of the average man .
in addition t o these evidences of larger savings , our people are steadily increasing their spending for higher standards of living .
today there are almost 9 automobiles for each 10 families , where seven and a half years ago only enough automobiles were running to average less than 4 for each 10 families .
the slogan of progress is changing from the full dinner pail to the full garage .
our people have more to eat , better things to wear , and better homes .
we have even gained in elbow room , for the increase of residential floor space is over 25 per cent with less than 10 per cent increase in our number of people .
wages have increased , the cost of living has decreased .
the job to every man and woman has been made more secure .
we have in this short period decreased the fear of poverty , the fear of unemployment , the fear of old age ; and these are fears that are the greatest calamities of human kind .
all this progress means far more than greater creature comforts .
it finds a thousand interpretations into a greater and fuller life .
a score of new helps save the drudgery of the home .
in seven years we have added 70 per cent to the electric power at the elbow of our workers and further promoted them from carriers of burdens to directors of machines .
we have steadily reduced the sweat in human labor .
our hours of labor are lessened ; our leisure has increased .
we have expanded our parks and playgrounds .
we have nearly doubled our attendance at games .
we pour into outdoor recreation in every direction .
the visitors at our national parks have trebled and we have so increased the number of sportsmen fishing in our streams and lakes that the longer time between bites is becoming a political issue .
in these seven and one - half years the radio has brought music and laughter , education and political discussion to almost every fireside .
springing from our prosperity with its greater freedom , its vast endowment of scientific research and the greater resources with which to care for public health , we have according to our insurance actuaries during this short period since the war lengthened the average span of life by nearly eight years .
we have reduced infant mortality , we have vastly decreased the days of illness and suffering in the life of every man and woman .
we have improved the facilities for the care of the crippled and helpless and deranged .
from our increasing resources we have expanded our educational system in eight years from an outlay of 1,200 millions to 2,700 millions of dollars .
the education of our youth has become almost our largest and certainly our most important activity .
from our greater income and thus our ability to free youth from toil we have increased the attendance in our grade schools by 14 per cent , in our high schools by 80 per cent , and in our institutions of higher learning by 95 per cent .
today we have more youth in these institutions of higher learning twice over than all the rest of the world put together .
we have made notable progress in literature , in art and in public taste .
we have made progress in the leadership of every branch of american life .
never in our history was the leadership in our economic life more distinguished in its abilities than today , and it has grown greatly in its consciousness of public responsibility .
leadership in our professions -- and in moral and spiritual affairs of our country was never of a higher order .
and our magnificent educational system is bringing forward a host of recruits for the succession to this leadership .
i do not need to recite more figures and more evidence .
i can not believe that the american people wish to abandon or in any way to weaken the principles of economic freedom and self - government which have been maintained by the republican party and which have produced results so amazing and so stimulating to the spiritual as well as to the material advance of the nation .
your city has been an outstanding beneficiary of this great progress and of these safeguarded principles .
with its suburbs it has , during the last seven and a half years , grown by over a million and a half of people until it has become the largest metropolitan district of all the world .
here you have made abundant opportunity not only for the youth of the land but for the immigrant from foreign shores .
this city is the commercial center of the united states .
it is the commercial agent of the american people .
it is a great organism of specialized skill and leadership in finance , industry and commerce , which reaches every spot in our country .
its progress and its beauty are the pride of the whole american people .
it leads our nation in its benevolences to charity , to education and scientific research .
it is the center of art , music , literature and drama .
it has come to have a more potent voice than any other city in the united states .
but when all is said and done the very life , progress and prosperity of this city is wholly dependent on the prosperity of the 115,000,000 people who dwell in our mountains and valleys across the 3,000 miles to the pacific ocean .
every activity of this city is sensitive to every evil and every favorable tide that sweeps this great nation of ours .
be there a slackening of industry in any place it affects new york far more than any other part of the country .
in a time of depression one - quarter of all the unemployed in the united states can be numbered in this city .
in a time of prosperity the citizens of the great interior of our country pour into your city for business and entertainment at the rate of 150,000 a day .
in fact , so much is this city the reflex of the varied interests of our country that the concern of everyone of your citizens for national stability , for national prosperity , for national progress , for preservation of our american system , is far greater than that of any other single part of our country .
we still have great problems if we would achieve the full economic advancement of our country .
in these past few years some groups in our country have lagged behind others in the march of progress .
i refer more particularly to those engaged in the textile , coal and in the agricultural industries .
we can assist in solving these problems by cooperation of our government .
to the agricultural industry we shall need to advance initial capital to assist them to stabilize their industry .
but this proposal implies that they shall conduct it themselves , and not by the government .
it is in the interest of our cities that we shall bring agriculture and all industries into full stability and prosperity .
i know you will gladly cooperate in the faith that in the common prosperity of our country lies its future .
in bringing this address to a conclusion i should like to restate to you some of the fundamental things i have endeavored to bring out .
the foundations of progress and prosperity are dependent as never before upon the wise policies of government , for government now touches at a thousand points the intricate web of economic and social life .
under administration by the republican party in the last 7 1/2 years our country as a whole has made unparalleled progress and this has been in generous part reflected to this great city .
prosperity is no idle expression .
it is a job for every worker ; it is the safety and the safeguard of every business and every home .
a continuation of the policies of the republican party is fundamentally necessary to the further advancement of this progress and to the further building up of this prosperity .
i have dwelt at some length on the principles of relationship between the government and business .
i make no apologies for dealing with this subject .
the first necessity of any nation is the smooth functioning of the vast business machinery for employment , feeding , clothing , housing and providing luxuries and comforts to a people .
unless these basic elements are properly organized and function , there can be no progress in business in education , literature , music or art .
there can be no advance in the fundamental ideals of a people .
a people can not make progress in poverty .
i have endeavored to present to you that the greatness of america has grown out of a political and social system and a method of control of economic forces distinctly its own -- our american system -- which has carried this great experiment in human welfare farther than ever before in all history .
we are nearer today to the ideal of the abolition of poverty and fear from the lives of men and women than ever before in any land .
and i again repeat that the departure from our american system by injecting principles destructive to it which our opponents propose will jeopardize the very liberty and freedom of our people , will destroy equality of opportunity not alone to ourselves but to our children .
to me the foundation of american life rests upon the home and the family .
i read into these great economic forces , these intricate and delicate relations of the government with business and with our political and social life , but one supreme end -- that we reinforce the ties that bind together the millions of our families , that we strengthen the security , the happiness and the independence of every home .
my conception of america is a land where men and women may walk in ordered freedom in the independent conduct of their occupations ; where they may enjoy the advantages of wealth , not concentrated in the hands of the few but spread through the lives of all , where they build and safeguard their homes , and give to their children the fullest advantages and opportunities of american life ; where every man shall be respected in the faith that his conscience and his heart direct him to follow ; where a contented and happy people , secure in their liberties , free from poverty and fear , shall have the leisure and impulse to seek a fuller life .
some may ask where all this may lead beyond mere material progress .
it leads to a release of the energies of men and women from the dull drudgery of life to a wider vision and a higher hope .
it leads to the opportunity for greater and greater service , not alone from man to man in our own land , but from our country to the whole world .
it leads to an america , healthy in body , healthy in spirit , unfettered , youthful , eager -- with a vision searching beyond the farthest horizons , with an open mind sympathetic and generous .
it is to these higher ideals and for these purposes that i pledge myself and the republican party .

my fellow citizens : 
 this broadcast tonight marks the beginning of the mobilization of the whole nation for a great undertaking to provide security for those of our citizens and their families who , through no fault of their own , face unemployment and privation during the coming winter .
its success depends upon the sympathetic and generous action of every man and woman in our country .
no one with a spark of human sympathy can contemplate unmoved the possibilities of suffering that can crush many of our unfortunate fellow americans if we shall fail them .
the depression has been deepened by events from abroad which are beyond the control either of our citizens or our government .
although it is but a passing incident in our national life , we must meet the consequences in unemployment which arise from it with that completeness of effort and that courage and spirit for which citizenship in this nation always has and always must stand .
as an important part of our plans for national unity of action in this emergency i have created a great national organization under the leadership of mr. walter gifford to cooperate with the governors , the state and the local agencies , and with the many national organizations of business , of labor , and of welfare , with the churches and our fraternal and patriotic societies so that the countless streams of human helpfulness which have been the mainstay of our country in all emergencies may be directed wisely and effectively .
over a thousand towns and cities have well - organized and experienced unemployment relief committees , community chests , or other agencies for the efficient administration of this relief .
with this occasion begins the nationwide movement to aid each of these volunteer organizations in securing the funds to meet their task over the forthcoming winter .
this organized effort is our opportunity to express our sympathy , to lighten the burdens of the heavy laden , and to cast sunshine into the habitation of despair .
the amounts sought by the committee in your town or city are in part to provide work , for it is through work that we wish to give help in keeping with the dignity of american manhood and womanhood .
but much of their funds are necessary to provide direct relief to those families where circumstances and ill fortune can only be met by direct assistance .
included in many community appeals are the sums necessary to the vital measures of health and character building , the maintenance of which were never more necessary than in these times .
the federal government is taking its part in aid to unemployment through the advancement and enlargement of public works in all parts of the nation .
through these works , it is today providing a livelihood for nearly 700,000 families .
all immigration has been stopped in order that our burdens should not be increased by unemployed immigrants from abroad .
measures have been adopted which will assure normal credits and thus stimulate employment in industry , in commerce , and in agriculture .
the employers in national industries have spread work amongst their employees so that the maximum number may participate in the wages which are available .
our states , our counties , our municipalities , through the expansion of their public works and through tax - supported relief activities , are doing their full part .
yet , beyond all this , there is a margin of relief which must be provided by voluntary action .
through these agencies americans must meet the demands of national conscience that there be no hunger or cold amongst our people .
similar organization and generous support were provided during the past winter in localities where it was necessary .
under the leadership of colonel woods , we succeeded in the task of that time .
we demonstrated that it could be done .
but in many localities our need will be greater this winter than a year ago .
while many are affected by the depression , the number who are threatened with privation is a minor percentage of our whole people .
this task is not beyond the ability of these thousands of community organizations to solve .
each local organization from its experience last winter and summer has formulated careful plans and made estimates completely to meet the need of that community .
i am confident that the generosity of each community will fully support these estimates .
the sum of these community efforts will meet the needs of the nation as a whole .
to solve this problem in this way accords with the fundamental sense of responsibility , neighbor to neighbor , community to community , upon which our nation is founded .
the possible misery of helpless people gives me more concern than any other trouble that this depression has brought upon us .
it is with these convictions in mind that i have the responsibility of opening this nationwide appeal to citizens in each community that they provide the funds with which , community by community , this task shall be met .
the maintenance of a spirit of mutual self - help through voluntary giving , through the responsibility of local government , is of infinite importance to the future of america .
everyone who aids to the full extent of his ability is giving support to the very foundations of our democracy .
everyone who from a sympathetic heart gives to these services is giving hope and courage to some deserving family .
everyone who aids in this service will have lighted a beacon of help on the stormy coast of human adversity .
the success and the character of nations are to be judged by the ideals and the spirit of its people .
time and again the american people have demonstrated a spiritual quality , a capacity for unity of action , of generosity , a certainty of results in time of emergency that have made them great in the annals of the history of all nations .
this is the time and this is the occasion when we must arouse that idealism , that spirit , that determination , that unity of action , from which there can be no failure in this primary obligation of every man to his neighbor and of a nation to its citizens , that none who deserve shall suffer .
i would that i possessed the art of words to fix the real issue with which the troubled world is faced in the mind and heart of every american man and woman .
our country and the world are today involved in more than a financial crisis .
we are faced with the primary question of human relations , which reaches to the very depths of organized society and to the very depths of human conscience .
this civilization and this great complex , which we call american life , is builded and can alone survive upon the translation into individual action of that fundamental philosophy announced by the savior 19 centuries ago .
part of our national suffering today is from failure to observe these primary yet inexorable laws of human relationship .
modern society can not survive with the defense of cain , " am i my brother 's keeper ? "
no governmental action , no economic doctrine , no economic plan or project can replace that god - imposed responsibility of the individual man and woman to their neighbors .
that is a vital part of the very soul of a people .
if we shall gain in this spirit from this painful time , we shall have created a greater and more glorious america .
the trial of it is here now .
it is a trial of the heart and the conscience , of individual men and women .
in a little over a month we shall celebrate our time - honored festival of thanksgiving .
i appeal to the american people to make november 26 next the outstanding thanksgiving day in the history of the united states ; that we may say on that day that america has again demonstrated her ideals ; that we have each of us contributed our full part ; that we in each of our communities have given full assurance against hunger and cold amongst our people ; that upon this thanksgiving day we have removed the fear of the forthcoming winter from the hearts of all who are suffering and in distress -- that we are our brother 's keeper .
i am on my way to participate in the commemoration of the victory of yorktown .
it is a name which brings a glow of pride to every american .
it recalls the final victory of our people after years of sacrifice and privation .
this nation passed through valley forge and came to yorktown .

members of the american bankers association and guests : 
 i am glad to meet with this assembly of representative bankers from every state and almost every county of our country .
during the past year you have carried the credit system of the nation safely through a most difficult crisis .
in this success you have demonstrated not alone the soundness of the credit system but also the capacity of our bankers in emergency .
we have had a severe shock and there has been disorganization in our economic system which has temporarily checked the march of prosperity .
but the fundamental assets of the nation , the education , intelligence , virility , and the spiritual strength of our 120 million people have been unimpaired .
the resources of our country in lands and mines are undiminished .
scientific discovery and invention have made further progress .
the gigantic equipment and unparalleled organization for production and distribution are in many parts even stronger than 2 years ago .
though our production and consumption has been slowed down to 85 or 90 percent of normal , yet by the very fact of the steady functioning of the major portion of our system do we have the assurance of our ability and the economic strength to overcome the decline .
the problem today is to complete the restoration of order in our ranks and to intensify our efforts to prevent such interruptions for the future .
and it is not a problem in academic economics .
it is a great human problem .
the margin of shrinkage brings loss of savings , unemployment , privation , hardship , and fear , which are no part of our ideals for the american economic system .
this depression is worldwide .
its causes and its effects lie only partly in the united states .
our country engaged in overspeculation in securities which crashed a year ago with great losses .
a perhaps even larger immediate cause of our depression has been the effect upon us from the collapse in prices following overproduction of important raw materials , mostly in foreign countries .
particularly had the planting of rubber , coffee , wheat , sugar , and to a lesser extent cotton , expanded beyond world consumption even in normal times .
the production of certain metals , such as silver , copper , and zinc , had likewise been overexpanded .
these major over - expansions have taken place largely outside of the united states .
their collapse has reduced the buying power of many countries .
the prosperity of brazil and colombia has been temporarily affected from the situation in coffee ; chile , peru , mexico , and australia from the fall in silver , zinc , and copper .
the buying power of india and china , dependent upon the price of silver has been affected .
australia , canada , and the argentine have been affected by the situation in wheat ; cuba and java have been depressed by the condition of the sugar industry ; east india generally has suffered from the fall in rubber .
these and other causes have produced in some of the countries affected some political unrest .
these economic disturbances have echoed in slowed - down demand for manufactured goods from europe and ourselves , with inevitable contribution to unemployment .
but the readjustments in prices , which were also inevitable , are far along their course .
most of these commodities are below the level at which sufficient production can be maintained for the world 's normal needs and , therefore , sooner or later must recover .
because the present depression is worldwide and because its causes were worldwide does not require that we should wait upon the recovery of the rest of the world .
we can make a very large degree of recovery independently of what may happen elsewhere .
i should like to remind you that we did precisely that thing in 1922 .
we were then experiencing the results of the collapse of war inflation in all commodities and in every direction .
we had less organized cooperation between the business community and the government to help mitigate that situation .
the rest of the world was in chaos from the war far more menacing both to economic and political stability than anything confronting us today .
our difficulties at that time were far more severe than they are at present .
the commercial banks particularly were sufferers from a large volume of frozen credits and enjoyed nothing to compare with the comfortable liquidity that prevails today .
we then had overexpansion and large stocks in most commodities ; today with one or two exceptions we are free from this deterrent .
but we led the world in recovery .
it was our independent recuperation from that depression , and the economic strength which we so liberally and largely furnished to other countries , that was the very basis for reconstruction of a war - demoralized world .
we are able in considerable degree to free ourselves of world influences and make a large measure of independent recovery because we are so remarkably self - contained .
because of this , while our economic system is subject to the shock of world influences , we should be able , in large measure , to readjust ourselves .
our national production is over one - third of the total of the whole commercial world .
we consume an average of about 90 percent of our own production of commodities .
if , for example , we assume a restored normal home consumption and held even our present reduced basis of exports , we should be upon a 97 percent of normal business basis .
even this illustration does not represent all of our self - contained strength .
we shall need mainly to depend upon our own strong arm for recovery , as other nations are in greater difficulty than we .
we shall need again to undertake to assist and cooperate with them .
our imports of commodities in the main depend upon our domestic prosperity .
any forward movement in our recovery creates a demand for foreign raw materials and goods and thus instantly reacts to assist other countries the world over .
i wish to take your time to discuss some of the pivotal relationships of the bankers not only to the immediate problem of recovery but to the wider problem of long - view business stability .
any discussion of the one involves the other .
before i enter upon that subject , however , i wish to say that no one can occupy the high office of president and conceivably be other than completely confident of the future of the united states .
perhaps as to no other place does the cheerful courage and power of a confident people reflect as to his office .
there are a few folks in business and several folks in the political world who resent the notion that things will ever get better and who wish to enjoy our temporary misery .
to recount to these persons the progress of cooperation between the people and the government in amelioration of this situation , or to mention that we are suffering far less than other countries , or that savings are piling up in the banks , or that our people are paying off installment purchases , that abundant capital is now pressing for new ventures and employment , only inspires the unkind retort that we should fix our gaze solely upon the unhappy features of the decline .
and , above all , to chide the pessimism of persons who have assumed the end of those mighty forces which for 150 years have driven this land further and further toward that great human goal -- the abolition of intellectual and economic poverty -- is perhaps not a sympathetic approach .
nevertheless , i always have been , and i remain , an unquenchable believer in the resistless , dynamic power of american enterprise .
this is no time - an audience of american leaders of business is no place -- to talk of any surrender .
we have known a thousand temporary setbacks , but the spirit of this people will never brook defeat .
our present situation is not a new experience .
these interruptions to the orderly march of progress have been recurrent for a century .
and apart from recovery from the present depression , the most urgent undertaking in our economic life is to devise further methods of preventing these storms .
we must assure a higher degree of business stability for the future .
the causes advanced for these movements are many and varied .
there is no simple explanation .
this is not an occasion for analysis of the many theories such as too little gold or the inflexible use of it .
whatever the remote causes may be , a large and immediate cause of most hard times is inflationary booms .
these strike some segment of economic life somewhere in the world , and their reechoing destructive results bring depression and hard times .
these inflations in currency or credit , in land or securities , or overexpansion in some sort of commodity production beyond possible demand even in good times -- may take place at home or abroad -- but they all bring retribution .
the leaders of business , of economic thought , and of government have , for the last decade , given earnest search into cause and remedy of this sort of instability .
much has already been accomplished to check the violence of the storms and to mitigate their distress .
as a result of these efforts the period of stable prosperity between storms is longer , the period of storm is shorter , and the relief work far more effective .
but we need not go beyond our situation today to confirm the need for further effort .
the economic fatalist believes that these crises are inevitable and bound to be recurrent .
i would remind these pessimists that exactly the same thing was once said of typhoid , cholera , and smallpox .
if medical science had sat down in a spirit of weak - kneed resignation and accepted these scourges as uncontrollable visitations of providence , we should still have them with us .
this is not the spirit of modern science .
science girds itself with painstaking research to find the nature and origin of disease and to devise methods for its prevention .
that should be our attitude toward these economic pestilences .
they are not dispensations of providence .
i am confident in the faith that their control , so far as the causes lie within our own boundaries , is within the genius of modern business .
we have all been much engaged with measures of relief from the effect of the collapse of a year ago .
at that time i determined that it was my duty , even without precedent , to call upon the business of the country for coordinated and constructive action to resist the forces of disintegration .
the business community , the bankers , labor , and the government have cooperated in wider spread measures of mitigation than have ever been attempted before .
our bankers and the reserve system have carried the country through the credit storm without impairment .
our leading business concerns have sustained wages , have distributed employment , have expedited heavy construction .
the government has expanded public works , assisted in credit to agriculture , and has restricted immigration .
these measures have maintained a higher degree of consumption than would have otherwise been the case .
they have thus prevented a large measure of unemployment .
they have provided much new employment .
our present experience in relief should form the basis of even more amplified plans in the future .
but in the long view the equally important thing is prevention .
we would need have less concern about what to do in bad times if we discovered and erected in good times further safeguards against the excesses which lead to these depressions .
american business has proved its capacity to solve some great human problems in economics .
the relation between employer and employee has here reached a more stable and satisfactory basis than anywhere else in the world .
we have largely solved the problem of how to secure the consumption of the gigantic increase of goods produced through that multiplication of per capita production by the application of science and the use of laborsaving devices .
that solution has been attained by sharing the savings in production costs between labor , capital , and the consumer , through increased wages and salaries to the worker , and decreased prices to the consumer with consequent increased buying power for still more goods .
every step in that solution is a revolution from the older theories of business .
we may safely assume that our economic future is safe so far as it is dependent upon a competent handling of problems of productivity .
but one result is to render further advance toward stability even more urgent , because with higher standards of living the whole system is more sensitive and the penalties of instability more widespread .
there is no one group of which the public expects so much in assuring stability as the bankers , because in the vortex of these storms many values lose their moorings .
nor can any other group contribute so much in constructive thought and action to solve the problem either today or in the long run .
three most important relationships to these business movements lie in the banker 's field .
the first is what , for lack of better terms , we call psychology -- both that contagious overoptimism which accelerates the inflation of the boom and those depths of fear and pessimism which deepen and prolong the depression .
the american banker has come to occupy a unique position in the strategy of stability , for he is the economic adviser of american business .
he is the listening post of economic movement .
he in large measure makes or tempers its psychology .
i do not suppose the banker has consciously sought this new function of general adviser , but such he has become .
his business is no longer the simple function of discounting commercial bills and lending money on first mortgages .
that is today but part of his work .
these days , when he establishes a line of credit to a business , or furnishes loans upon securities of a business , or advises investment in a business , he must know the elements which make for success and failure of that business .
and he must form judgment as to the future trend of business in general .
on the other side , the american businessman , big and little , the farmer , and the labor leader are coming more and more to consult with the banker on problems of his business .
whatever the origin of his position may be , the banker is now the economic guide , philosopher , and friend of his customers , and his philosophy can dampen our enthusiasm and equally it can lift our courage and hope .
the second point of the banker 's unique position in relation to business trends lies in the part which credit plays in the whole business process .
obviously during the inflationary period the use of credit for unwise expansion and speculation draws away the supply of credit from normal business .
it imposes upon normal business an interest rate which strangles the orderly commerce of the country .
commerce sickens under this pressure , its pace slackens and contributes to collapse .
therefore , i wish to emphasize what has long been recognized -- that is , that the flow of credit can accelerate and it can retard such movements .
equally a wise direction of credit provides a large contribution to recovery from depressions .
the third reason why this is so much a banker 's problem is that banking is the one great line of business activity that is in itself interconnected .
each credit institution shares the credit burdens of others and all are largely coordinated through national organization -- the federal reserve system .
the reserve system and its member banks and the treasury participation , in fact , form a widespread cooperative organization , acting in the broad interest of the whole people .
to a large degree it can influence the flow of credit .
bankers themselves are represented at each stage of management .
and , in addition , the various boards and advisory committees represent also industry , agriculture , merchandising , and the government .
the reserve system , therefore , furnishes an admirable center for cooperation of the banking business with the production and distribution industries and the government in the development of broad and detached policies of business stability .
you have gained much experience from the two great crises of recent years .
i trust you will seriously and systematically consider what further effective measures can be taken either in the business world or in cooperation with the government in development of such policies , both for the present depression and for the future .
i know of no greater public service .
it is a service to every businessman , to every farmer , to every worker , whether at the desk or bench .
i am not assuming you can do it all , or that all disturbance , domestic or foreign , can be wholly prevented or cured .
the government should cooperate .
it plays a large part in the credit structure of the country .
its fiscal system has most important bearings .
for instance , i believe an inquiry might develop that our system of taxes upon capital gains directly encourages inflation by strangling the free movement of land and securities .
the regulatory functions of the federal and state governments also have a bearing on this subject through their effect upon the financial strength of the railways and utilities .
during a period of depression , the soundest and most available method of relief to unemployment is expansion of public works and construction in the utilities , railways , and heavy industries .
the volume of possible expansion of construction in these private industries is about four or five times that in public works .
during the present depression these industries have done their full part , but especially the railways have been handicapped by some provisions of the transportation act of 1920 .
with wider public vision the railways could be strengthened into a greater balance wheel of stability .
we have need to consider all of our economic legislation , whether banking , utilities , or agriculture , or anything else , from the point of view of its effect upon business stability .
i have never believed that our form of government could satisfactorily solve economic problems by direct action -- could successfully conduct business institutions .
the government can and must cure abuses .
what the government can do best is to encourage and assist in the creation and development of institutions controlled by our citizens and evolved by themselves from their own needs and their own experience and directed in a sense of a trusteeship of public interest .
the federal reserve is such an institution .
without intrusion the government can sometimes give leadership and serve to bring together divergent elements and secure cooperation in development of ideas , measures , and institutions .
that is a reenforcement of our individualism .
it does not cripple the initiative and enterprise of our people by the substitution of government .
proper cooperation among our people in public interest , and continuation of such institutional growths , strengthen the whole foundation of the nation , for self - government outside of political government is the truest form of self - government .
it is in this manner that these problems should be met and solved .
i wish to revert to the influence of the bankers , through encouragement and leadership , in expedition of our recovery from the present situation .
you have already done much , and at this juncture the responsibility of those in control of money and credit is very great .
without faith on your part and without your good offices , the early return to full prosperity can not be accomplished .
this depression will be shortened largely to the degree that you feel that you can prudently , by counsel and specific assistance , instill into your clients from industry , agriculture , and commerce a feeling of assurance .
we know that one of the prerequisites of ending a depression is an ample supply of credit at low rates of interest .
this supply and these rates are now available through the cooperation of the banks and the federal reserve system .
the income of a large part of our people is not reduced by the depression , but it is affected by unnecessary fears and pessimism , the result of which is to slacken the consumption of goods and discourage enterprise .
here the very atmosphere of your offices will affect the mental attitude and , if you please , courage , of the individuals who will depend upon you for both counsel and money .
many , perhaps all of you , have been through other periods of depression .
those of you who have had occasion to review the experience of the past will , i believe , join in the thought that there comes a time in every depression when the changed attitude of the financial agencies can help the upward movement in our economic forces .
i started with the premise that this question of stability was much more than a problem in academic economics -- it is a great human problem , for it involves the happiness of millions of homes .
a continued unity of effort , both in our present situation and in establishing safeguards for the future , is the need of today .
no one can contribute more than our banking community .
it appears from the press that someone suggested in your discussion that our american standards of living should be lowered .
to that i emphatically disagree .
i do not believe it represents the views of this association .
not only do i not accept such a theory , but on the contrary , the whole purpose and ideal of this economic system which is distinctive of our country , is to increase the standard of living by the adoption and the constantly widening diffusion of invention and discovery amongst the whole of our people .
any retreat from our american philosophy of constantly increasing standards of living becomes a retreat into perpetual unemployment and the acceptance of a cesspool of poverty for some large part of our people .
our economic system is but an instrument of the social advancement of the american people .
it is an instrument by which we add to the security and richness of life of every individual .
it by no means comprises the whole purpose of life , but it is the foundation upon which can be built the finer things of the spirit .
increase in enrichment must be the objective of the nation , not decrease .
in conclusion , i would again profess my own undaunted faith in those mighty spiritual and intellectual forces of liberty , self - government , initiative , invention , and courage , which have throughout our whole national life motivated our progress , and driven us ever forward .
these forces , which express the true genius of our people , are undiminished .
they have already shown their ability to resist this immediate shock .
any recession in american business is but a temporary halt in the prosperity of a great people .

in my messages of june 6th and december 3rd , 1929 , i placed before congress the urgency of certain improvements necessary to effective criminal law enforcement .
substantial progress has been made upon some of the measures proposed , yet we are nearing the end of the present session , and i can not too strongly urge the necessity of action upon all these recommendations before adjournment .
the most important recommendations made by me were five in number : 
 1 .
there should be a transfer of the functions of detection and prosecution of prohibition cases from the treasury department to the department of justice , and thus an ending of divided responsibility and effort .
an act providing for this transfer was passed by the house of representatives and has now been reported to the senate by its judiciary committee .
2 .
there must be relief afforded from congestion in the courts .
while this congestion is evidenced by the dockets in many courts , its full implications are not shown by them .
the so - called bargain days , when light fines are imposed as the result of pleas of guilty , clear the docket but the result distinctly undermines respect for law .
no conclusion appears to have been reached as to the method of accomplishing this either by the judiciary committee of the senate or by the judiciary committee of the house of representatives .
3 .
there must be extension of federal prisons with more adequate parole system and other modern treatment of prisoners .
we have already 11,985 prisoners in federal establishments built for 6,946 .
the number of federal prisoners in federal and state institutions increased 6,277 in the nine months from june 30 , 1929 , to april 1 , 1930 .
the attorney general has stated that we can not hope to enforce the laws unless we can have some point of reception for convicted persons .
the overcrowding of the prisons themselves is inhumane and accentuates criminal tendencies .
bills providing for this relief were passed by the house and are now , i understand , in course of being reported to the senate by the judiciary committee .
4 .
we are in need of vigorous reorganization of the border patrol in order to consolidate various agencies so as effectually to prevent illegal entry of both aliens and goods .
proposals to bring about such reorganization are before the committees of congress .
5 .
the district of columbia is without an adequate prohibition enforcement law .
a bill for that purpose has been introduced and hearings have been held before the senate district committee .
it should contain the safeguards recommended by the attorney general .
we have within the limits of existing legislation improved the personnel and greatly increased the efficiency of the existing federal machinery in criminal law enforcement during the past year .
the above reforms are necessary , however , if i am to perform the high duty which fails upon the executive of enforcement of the federal laws .
while a considerable part of this condition arises from the laws relating to intoxicating liquors , yet the laws relating to narcotics , automobile thefts , etc . ,
which have been enacted by the congress during recent years , also contribute to create the present conditions .
this is well indicated by the fact that less than one third of federal prisoners are due to prohibition .
our obedience to law , our law enforcement and judicial organization , our judicial procedure , our care and methods of handling prisoners , in relation to not only federal government but also to the state and municipal governments , are far from the standards that must be secured .
these proposals , while they do not comprehend the whole which remains to be done in the nation , are a step toward lifting the federal standards which must have a general beneficial influence .

to the senate and house of representatives : 
 it is my duty under the constitution to transmit to the congress information on the state of the union and to recommend for its consideration necessary and expedient measures .
the chief influence affecting the state of the union during the past year has been the continued world - wide economic disturbance .
our national concern has been to meet the emergencies it has created for us and to lay the foundations for recovery .
if we lift our vision beyond these immediate emergencies we find fundamental national gains even amid depression .
in meeting the problems of this difficult period , we have witnessed a remarkable development of the sense of cooperation in the community .
for the first time in the history of our major economic depressions there has been a notable absence of public disorders and industrial conflict .
above all there is an enlargement of social and spiritual responsibility among the people .
the strains and stresses upon business have resulted in closer application , in saner policies , and in better methods .
public improvements have been carried out on a larger scale than even in normal times .
the country is richer in physical property , in newly discovered resources , and in productive capacity than ever before .
there has been constant gain in knowledge and education ; there has been continuous advance in science and invention ; there has been distinct gain in public health .
business depressions have been recurrent in the life of our country and are but transitory .
the nation has emerged from each of them with increased strength and virility because of the enlightenment they have brought , the readjustments and the larger understanding of the realities and obligations of life and work which come from them .
both our army and navy have been maintained in a high state of efficiency .
the ability and devotion of both officers and men sustain the highest traditions of the service .
reductions and postponements in expenditure of these departments to meet the present emergency are being made without reducing existing personnel or impairing the morale of either establishment .
the agreement between the leading naval powers for limitation of naval armaments and establishment of their relative strength and thus elimination of competitive building also implies for ourselves the gradual expansion of the deficient categories in our navy to the parities provided in those treaties .
however , none of the other nations , parties to these agreements , is to - day maintaining the full rate of construction which the treaty size of fleets would imply .
although these agreements secured the maximum reduction of fleets which it was at that time possible to attain , i am hopeful that the naval powers , party to these agreements , will realize that establishment of relative strength in itself offers opportunity for further reduction without injury to any of them .
this would be the more possible if pending negotiations are successful between france and italy .
if the world is to regain its standards of life , it must further decrease both naval and other arms .
the subject will come before the general disarmament conference which meets in geneva on february 2 

 we are at peace with the world .
we have cooperated with other nations to preserve peace .
the rights of our citizens abroad have been protected .
the economic depression has continued and deepened in every part of the world during the past year .
in many countries political instability , excessive armaments , debts , governmental expenditures , and taxes have resulted in revolutions , in unbalanced budgets and monetary collapse and financial panics , in dumping of goods upon world markets , and in diminished consumption of commodities .
within two years there have been revolutions or acute social disorders in 19 countries , embracing more than half the population of the world .
ten countries have been unable to meet their external obligations .
in 14 countries , embracing a quarter of the world 's population , former monetary standards have been temporarily abandoned .
in a number of countries there have been acute financial panics or compulsory restraints upon banking .
these disturbances have many roots in the dislocations from the world war .
every one of them has reacted upon us .
they have sharply affected the markets and prices of our agricultural and industrial products .
they have increased unemployment and greatly embarrassed our financial and credit system .
as our difficulties during the past year have plainly originated in large degree from these sources , any effort to bring about our own recuperation has dictated the necessity of cooperation by us with other nations in reasonable effort to restore world confidence and economic stability .
cooperation of our federal reserve system and our banks with the central banks in foreign countries has contributed to localize and ameliorate a number of serious financial crises or moderate the pressures upon us and thus avert disasters which would have affected us .
the economic crisis in germany and central europe last june rose to the dimensions of a general panic from which it was apparent that without assistance these nations must collapse .
apprehensions of such collapse had demoralized our agricultural and security markets and so threatened other nations as to impose further dangers upon us .
but of highest importance was the necessity of cooperation on our part to relieve the people of germany from imminent disasters and to maintain their important relations to progress and stability in the world .
upon the initiative of this government a year 's postponement of reparations and other intergovernmental debts was brought about .
upon our further initiative an agreement was made by germany 's private creditors providing for an extension of such credits until the german people can develop more permanent and definite forms of relief .
we have continued our policy of withdrawing our marines from haiti and nicaragua .
the difficulties between china and japan have given us great concern , not alone for the maintenance of the spirit of the kellogg - briand pact , but for the maintenance of the treaties to which we are a party assuring the territorial integrity of china .
it is our purpose to assist in finding solutions sustaining the full spirit of those treaties .
i shall deal at greater length with our foreign relations in a later message .
many undertakings have been organized and forwarded during the past year to meet the new and changing emergencies which have constantly confronted us .
broadly the community has cooperated to meet the needs of honest distress , and to take such emergency measures as would sustain confidence in our financial system and would cushion the violence of liquidation in industry and commerce , thus giving time for orderly readjustment of costs , inventories , and credits without panic and widespread bankruptcy .
these measures have served those purposes and will promote recovery .
in these measures we have striven to mobilize and stimulate private initiative and local and community responsibility .
there has been the least possible government entry into the economic field , and that only in temporary and emergency form .
our citizens and our local governments have given a magnificent display of unity and action , initiative and patriotism in solving a multitude of difficulties and in cooperating with the federal government .
for a proper understanding of my recommendations to the congress it is desirable very briefly to review such activities during the past year .
the emergencies of unemployment have been met by action in many directions .
the appropriations for the continued speeding up of the great federal construction program have provided direct and indirect aid to employment upon a large scale .
by organized unity of action , the states and municipalities have also maintained large programs of public improvement .
many industries have been prevailed upon to anticipate and intensify construction .
industrial concerns and other employers have been organized to spread available work amongst all their employees , instead of discharging a portion of them .
a large majority have maintained wages at as high levels as the safe conduct of their business would permit .
this course has saved us from industrial conflict and disorder which have characterized all previous depressions .
immigration has been curtailed by administrative action .
upon the basis of normal immigration the decrease amounts to about 300,000 individuals who otherwise would have been added to our unemployment .
the expansion of federal employment agencies under appropriations by the congress has proved most effective .
through the president 's organization for unemployment relief , public and private agencies were successfully mobilized last winter to provide employment and other measures against distress .
similar organization gives assurance against suffering during the coming winter .
committees of leading citizens are now active at practically every point of unemployment .
in the large majority they have been assured the funds necessary which , together with local government aids , will meet the situation .
a few exceptional localities will be further organized .
the evidence of the public health service shows an actual decrease of sickness and infant and general mortality below normal years .
no greater proof could be adduced that our people have been protected from hunger and cold and that the sense of social responsibility in the nation has responded to the need of the unfortunate .
to meet the emergencies in agriculture the loans authorized by congress for rehabilitation in the drought areas have enabled farmers to produce abundant crops in those districts .
the red cross undertook and magnificently administered relief for over 2,500,000 drought sufferers last winter .
it has undertaken this year to administer relief to 100,000 sufferers in the new drought area of certain northwest states .
the action of the federal farm board in granting credits to farm cooperatives saved many of them from bankruptcy and increased their purpose and strength .
by enabling farm cooperatives to cushion the fall in prices of farm products in 1930 and 1931 the board secured higher prices to the farmer than would have been obtained otherwise , although the benefits of this action were partially defeated by continued world overproduction .
incident to this action the failure of a large number of farmers and of country banks was averted which could quite possibly have spread into a major disaster .
the banks in the south have cooperated with the farm board in creation of a pool for the better marketing of accumulated cotton .
growers have been materially assisted by this action .
constant effort has been made to reduce overproduction in relief of agriculture and to promote the foreign buying of agricultural products by sustaining economic stability abroad .
to meet our domestic emergencies in credit and banking arising from the reaction to acute crisis abroad the national credit association was set up by the banks with resources of $ 500,000,000 to support sound banks against the frightened withdrawals and hoarding .
it is giving aid to reopen solvent banks which have been closed .
federal officials have brought about many beneficial unions of banks and have employed other means which have prevented many bank closings .
as a result of these measures the hoarding withdrawals which had risen to over $ 250,000,000 per week after the british crisis have substantially ceased .
the major economic forces and weaknesses at home and abroad have now been exposed and can be appraised , and the time is ripe for forward action to expedite our recovery .
although some of the causes of our depression are due to speculation , inflation of securities and real estate , unsound foreign investments , and mismanagement of financial institutions , yet our self - contained national economy , with its matchless strength and resources , would have enabled us to recover long since but for the continued dislocations , shocks , and setbacks from abroad .
whatever the causes may be , the vast liquidation and readjustments which have taken place have left us with a large degree of credit paralysis , which together with the situation in our railways and the conditions abroad , are now the outstanding obstacles to recuperation .
if we can put our financial resources to work and can ameliorate the financial situation in the railways , i am confident we can make a large measure of recovery independent of the rest of the world .
a strong america is the highest contribution to world stability .
one phase of the credit situation is indicated in the banks .
during the past year banks , representing 3 per cent of our total deposits have been closed .
a large part of these failures have been caused by withdrawals for hoarding , as distinguished from the failures early in the depression where weakness due to mismanagement was the larger cause of failure .
despite their closing , many of them will pay in full .
although such withdrawals have practically ceased , yet $ 1,100,000,000 of currency was previously withdrawn which has still to return to circulation .
this represents a large reduction of the ability of our banks to extend credit which would otherwise fertilize industry and agriculture .
furthermore , many of our bankers , in order to prepare themselves to meet possible withdrawals , have felt compelled to call in loans , to refuse new credits , and to realize upon securities , which in turn has demoralized the markets .
the paralysis has been further augmented by the steady increase in recent years of the proportion of bank assets invested in long - term securities , such as mortgages and bonds .
these securities tend to lose their liquidity in depression or temporarily to fall in value so that the ability of the banks to meet the shock of sudden withdrawal is greatly lessened and the restriction of all kinds of credit is thereby increased .
the continuing credit paralysis has operated to accentuate the deflation and liquidation of commodities , real estate , and securities below any reasonable basis of values .
all of this tends to stifle business , especially the smaller units , and finally expresses itself in further depression of prices and values , in restriction on new enterprise , and in increased unemployment .
the situation largely arises from an unjustified lack of confidence .
we have enormous volumes of idle money in the banks and in hoarding .
we do not require more money or working capital -- we need to put what we have to work .
the fundamental difficulties which have brought about financial strains in foreign countries do not exist in the united states .
no external drain on our resources can threaten our position , because the balance of international payments is in our favor ; we owe less to foreign countries than they owe to us ; our industries are efficiently organized ; our currency and bank deposits are protected by the greatest gold reserve in history .
our first step toward recovery is to reestablish confidence and thus restore the flow of credit which is the very basis of our economic life .
we must put some steel beams in the foundations of our credit structure .
it is our duty to apply the full strength of our government not only to the immediate phases , but to provide security against shocks and the repetition of the weaknesses which have been proven .
the recommendations which i here lay before the congress are designed to meet these needs by strengthening financial , industrial , and agricultural life through the medium of our existing institutions , and thus to avoid the entry of the government into competition with private business .
the first requirement of confidence and of economic recovery is financial stability of the united states government .
i shall deal with fiscal questions at greater length in the budget message .
but i must at this time call attention to the magnitude of the deficits which have developed and the resulting necessity for determined and courageous policies .
these deficits arise in the main from the heavy decrease in tax receipts due to the depression and to the increase in expenditure on construction in aid to unemployment , aids to agriculture , and upon services to veterans .
during the fiscal year ending june 30 last we incurred a deficit of about $ 903,000,000 , which included the statutory reduction of the debt and represented an increase of the national debt by $ 616,000,000 .
of this , however , $ 153,000,000 is offset by increased cash balances .
in comparison with the fiscal year 1928 there is indicated a fall in federal receipts for the present fiscal year amounting to $ 1,683,000,000 , of which $ 1,034,000,000 is in individual and corporate income taxes alone .
during this fiscal year there will be an increased expenditure , as compared to 1928 , on veterans of $ 255,000,000 , and an increased expenditure on construction work which may reach $ 520,000,000 .
despite large economies in other directions , we have an indicated deficit , including the statutory retirement of the debt , of $ 2,123,000,000 , and an indicated net debt increase of about $ 1,711,000,000 .
the budget for the fiscal year beginning july 1 next , after allowing for some increase of taxes under the present laws and after allowing for drastic reduction in expenditures , still indicates a deficit of $ 1,417,000,000 .
after offsetting the statutory debt retirements this would indicate an increase in the national debt for the fiscal year 1933 of about $ 921,000,000 .
several conclusions are inevitable .
we must have insistent and determined reduction in government expenses .
we must face a temporary increase in taxes .
such increase should not cover the whole of these deficits or it will retard recovery .
we must partially finance the deficit by borrowing .
it is my view that the amount of taxation should be fixed so as to balance the budget for 1933 except for the statutory debt retirement .
such government receipts would assure the balance of the following year 's budget including debt retirement .
it is my further view that the additional taxation should be imposed solely as an emergency measure terminating definitely two years from july 1 next .
such a basis will give confidence in the determination of the government to stabilize its finance and will assure taxpayers of its temporary character .
even with increased taxation , the government will reach the utmost safe limit of its borrowing capacity by the expenditures for which we are already obligated and the recommendations here proposed .
to go further than these limits in either expenditures , taxes , or borrowing will destroy confidence , denude commerce and industry of its resources , jeopardize the financial system , and actually extend unemployment and demoralize agriculture rather than relieve it .
i recommend that the congress authorize the subscription by the treasury of further capital to the federal land banks to be retired as provided in the original act , or when funds are available , and that repayments of such capital be treated as a fund available for further subscriptions in the same manner .
it is urgent that the banks be supported so as to stabilize the market values of their bonds and thus secure capital for the farmers at low rates , that they may continue their services to agriculture and that they may meet the present situation with consideration to the farmers .
a method should be devised to make available quickly to depositors some portion of their deposits in closed banks as the assets of such banks may warrant .
such provision would go far to relieve distress in a multitude of families , would stabilize values in many communities , and would liberate working capital to thousands of concerns .
i recommend that measures be enacted promptly to accomplish these results and i suggest that the congress should consider the development of such a plan through the federal reserve banks .
i recommend the establishment of a system of home - loan discount banks as the necessary companion in our financial structure of the federal reserve banks and our federal land banks .
such action will relieve present distressing pressures against home and farm property owners .
it will relieve pressures upon and give added strength to building and loan associations , savings banks , and deposit banks , engaged in extending such credits .
such action would further decentralize our credit structure .
it would revive residential construction and employment .
it would enable such loaning institutions more effectually to promote home ownership .
i discussed this plan at some length in a statement made public november 14 , last .
this plan has been warmly indorsed by the recent national conference upon home ownership and housing , whose members were designated by the governors of the states and the groups interested .
in order that the public may be absolutely assured and that the government may be in position to meet any public necessity , i recommend that an emergency reconstruction corporation of the nature of the former war finance corporation should be established .
it may not be necessary to use such an instrumentality very extensively .
the very existence of such a bulwark will strengthen confidence .
the treasury should be authorized to subscribe a reasonable capital to it , and it should be given authority to issue its own debentures .
it should be placed in liquidation at the end of two years .
its purpose is that by strengthening the weak spots to thus liberate the full strength of the nation 's resources .
it should be in position to facilitate exports by american agencies ; make advances to agricultural credit agencies where necessary to protect and aid the agricultural industry ; to make temporary advances upon proper securities to established industries , railways , and financial institutions which can not otherwise secure credit , and where such advances will protect the credit structure and stimulate employment .
its functions would not overlap those of the national credit corporation .
on october 6th i issued a statement that i should recommend to the congress an extension during emergencies of the eligibility provisions in the federal reserve act .
this statement was approved by a representative gathering of the members of both houses of the congress , including members of the appropriate committees .
it was approved by the officials of the treasury department , and i understand such an extension has been approved by a majority of the governors of the federal reserve banks .
nothing should be done which would lower the safeguards of the system .
the establishment of the mortgage - discount banks herein referred to will also contribute to further reserve strength in the banks without inflation .
our people have a right to a banking system in which their deposits shall be safeguarded and the flow of credit less subject to storms .
the need of a sounder system is plainly shown by the extent of bank failures .
i recommend the prompt improvement of the banking laws .
changed financial conditions and commercial practices must be met .
the congress should investigate the need for separation between different kinds of banking ; an enlargement of branch banking under proper restrictions ; and the methods by which enlarged membership in the federal reserve system may be brought about .
the postal savings deposits have increased from about $ 200,000,000 to about $ 550,000,000 during the past year .
this experience has raised important practical questions in relation to deposits and investments which should receive the attention of the congress .
the railways present one of our immediate and pressing problems .
they are and must remain the backbone of our transportation system .
their prosperity is interrelated with the prosperity of all industries .
their fundamental service in transportation , the volume of their employment , their buying power for supplies from other industries , the enormous investment in their securities , particularly their bonds , by insurance companies , savings banks , benevolent and other trusts , all reflect their partnership in the whole economic fabric .
through these institutions the railway bonds are in a large sense the investment of every family .
the well - maintained and successful operation and the stability of railway finances are of primary importance to economic recovery .
they should have more effective opportunity to reduce operating costs by proper consolidation .
as their rates must be regulated in public interest , so also approximate regulation should be applied to competing services by some authority .
the methods of their regulation should be revised .
the interstate commerce commission has made important and far - reaching recommendations upon the whole subject , which i commend to the early consideration of the congress .
in my message of a year ago i commented on the necessity of congressional inquiry into the economic action of the antitrust laws .
there is wide conviction that some change should be made especially in the procedure under these laws .
i do not favor their repeal .
such action would open wide the door to price fixing , monopoly , and destruction of healthy competition .
particular attention should be given to the industries rounded upon natural resources , especially where destructive competition produces great wastes of these resources and brings great hardships upon operators , employees , and the public .
in recent years there has been continued demoralization in the bituminous coal , oil , and lumber industries .
i again commend the matter to the consideration of the congress .
as an aid to unemployment the federal government is engaged in the greatest program of public - building , harbor , flood - control , highway , waterway , aviation , merchant and naval ship construction in all history .
our expenditures on these works during this calendar year will reach about $ 780,000,000 compared with $ 260,000,000 in 1928 .
through this increased construction , through the maintenance of a full complement of federal employees , and through services to veterans it is estimated that the federal taxpayer is now directly contributing to the livelihood of 10,000,000 of our citizens .
we must avoid burdens upon the government which will create more unemployment in private industry than can be gained by further expansion of employment by the federal government .
we can now stimulate employment and agriculture more effectually and speedily through the voluntary measures in progress , through the thawing out of credit , through the building up of stability abroad , through the home loan discount banks , through an emergency finance corporation and the rehabilitation of the railways and other such directions .
i am opposed to any direct or indirect government dole .
the breakdown and increased unemployment in europe is due in part to such practices .
our people are providing against distress from unemployment in true american fashion by a magnificent response to public appeal and by action of the local governments .
there are many other subjects requiring legislative action at this session of the congress .
i may list the following among them : 

 the law enacted last march authorizing loans of 50 per cent upon adjusted - service certificates has , together with the loans made under previous laws , resulted in payments of about $ 1,260,000,000 .
appropriations have been exhausted .
the administrator of veterans ' affairs advises that a further appropriation of $ 200,000,000 is required at once to meet the obligations made necessary by existing legislation .
there will be demands for further veterans ' legislation ; there are inequalities in our system of veterans ' relief ; it is our national duty to meet our obligations to those who have served the nation .
but our present expenditure upon these services now exceeds $ 1,000,000,000 per annum .
i am opposed to any extension of these expenditures until the country has recovered from the present situation .
i have recommended in previous messages the effective regulation of interstate electrical power as the essential function of the reorganized federal power commission .
i renew the recommendation .
it is urgently needed in public protection .
at my suggestion , the governors and legislatures of alabama and tennessee selected three members each for service on a committee to which i appointed a representative of the farm organizations and two representatives of the war department for the purpose of recommending a plan for the disposal of these properties which would be in the interest of the people of those states and the agricultural industry throughout the country .
i shall transmit the recommendations to the congress .
i have referred in previous messages to the profound need of further reorganization and consolidation of federal administrative functions to eliminate overlap and waste , and to enable coordination and definition of government policies now wholly impossible in scattered and conflicting agencies which deal with parts of the same major function .
i shall lay before the congress further recommendations upon this subject , particularly in relation to the department of the interior .
there are two directions of such reorganization , however , which have an important bearing upon the emergency problems with which we are confronted .
at present the shipping board exercises large administrative functions independent of the executive .
these administrative functions should be transferred to the department of commerce , in keeping with that single responsibility which has been the basis of our governmental structure since its foundation .
there should be created in that department a position of assistant secretary for merchant marine , under whom this work and the several bureaus having to do with merchant marine may be grouped .
the shipping board should be made a regulatory body acting also in advisory capacity on loans and policies , in keeping with its original conception .
its regulatory powers should be amended to include regulation of coastwise shipping so as to assure stability and better service .
it is also worthy of consideration that the regulation of rates and services upon the inland waterways should be assigned to such a reorganized board .
i recommend that all building and construction activities of the government now carried on by many departments be consolidated into an independent establishment under the president to be known as the " public works administration " directed by a public works administrator .
this agency should undertake all construction work in service to the different departments of the government ( except naval and military work ) .
the services of the corps of army engineers should be delegated in rotation for military duty to this administration in continuation of their supervision of river and harbor work .
great economies , sounder policies , more effective coordination to employment , and expedition in all construction work would result from this consolidation .
i shall present some recommendations in a special message looking to the strengthening of criminal - law enforcement and improvement in judicial procedure connected therewith .
these improvements are now proceeding upon an unprecedented scale .
some indication of the volume of work in progress is conveyed by the fact that during the current year over 380,000,000 cubic yards of material have been moved -- an amount equal to the entire removal in the construction of the panama canal .
the mississippi waterway system , connecting chicago , kansas city , pittsburgh , and new orleans , will be in full operation during 1933 .
substantial progress is being made upon the projects of the upper missouri , upper mississippi , etc .
negotiations are now in progress with canada for the construction of the st. lawrence waterway .
wages and standards of living abroad have been materially lowered during the past year .
the temporary abandonment of the gold standard by certain countries has also reduced their production costs compared to ours .
fortunately any increases in the tariff which may be necessary to protect agriculture and industry from these lowered foreign costs , or decreases in items which may prove to be excessive , may be undertaken at any time by the tariff commission under authority which it possesses by virtue of the tariff act of 1930 .
the commission during the past year has reviewed the rates upon over 254 items subject to tariff .
as a result of vigorous and industrious action , it is up to date in the consideration of pending references and is prepared to give prompt attention to any further applications .
this procedure presents an orderly method for correcting inequalities .
i am opposed to any general congressional revision of the tariff .
such action would disturb industry , business , and agriculture .
it would prolong the depression .
i recommend that immigration restriction now in force under administrative action be placed upon a more definite basis by law .
the deportation laws should be strengthened .
aliens lawfully in the country should be protected by the issuance of a certificate of residence .
i again call attention to my previous recommendations upon this subject , particularly in its relation to children .
the moral results are of the utmost importance .
it is inevitable that in these times much of the legislation proposed to the congress and many of the recommendations of the executive must be designed to meet emergencies .
in reaching solutions we must not jeopardize those principles which we have found to be the basis of the growth of the nation .
the federal government must not encroach upon nor permit local communities to abandon that precious possession of local initiative and responsibility .
again , just as the largest measure of responsibility in the government of the nation rests upon local self - government , so does the largest measure of social responsibility in our country rest upon the individual .
if the individual surrenders his own initiative and responsibilities , he is surrendering his own freedom and his own liberty .
it is the duty of the national government to insist that both the local governments and the individual shall assume and bear these responsibilities as a fundamental of preserving the very basis of our freedom .
many vital changes and movements of vast proportions are taking place in the economic world .
the effect of these changes upon the future can not be seen clearly as yet .
of this , however , we are sure : our system , based upon the ideals of individual initiative and of equality of opportunity , is not an artificial thing .
rather it is the outgrowth of the experience of america , and expresses the faith and spirit of our people .
it has carried us in a century and a half to leadership of the economic world .
if our economic system does not match our highest expectations at all times , it does not require revolutionary action to bring it into accord with any necessity that experience may prove .
it has successfully adjusted itself to changing conditions in the past .
it will do so again .
the mobility of our institutions , the richness of our resources , and the abilities of our people enable us to meet them unafraid .
it is a distressful time for many of our people , but they have shown qualities as high in fortitude , courage , and resourcefulness as ever in our history .
with that spirit , i have faith that out of it will come a sounder life , a truer standard of values , a greater recognition of the results of honest effort , and a healthier atmosphere in which to rear our children .
ours must be a country of such stability and security as can not fail to carry forward and enlarge among all the people that abundant life of material and spiritual opportunity which it has represented among all nations since its beginning .

my countrymen and women of the radio audience : 
 of the untold values of the radio , one is the great intimacy it has brought among our people .
through its mysterious channels we come to wider acquaintance with surroundings and men .
the microphone for these few moments has been brought to the president 's study in the east wing of the white house .
this room from which i speak was the scene of work and accomplishment of our presidents for over a century .
into this room first came john adams , who had taken over the reins of administration of the newly established republic from george washington .
each president in the long procession of years down to roosevelt worked at this fireside .
in the refurnishing of the white house by mr. roosevelt , the president 's study was moved to another room which was used by our presidents from mr. taft to mr. coolidge .
but recent extensions to the white house made it possible for me to restore the president 's study to this room , where still lingers the invisible presence of so many of our great men .
it is here where the adamses , father and son , jefferson , monroe , jackson , grant , mckinley , roosevelt , and a score of other devoted men worked .
here worked lincoln .
in this room he signed the emancipation of the negro race from slavery .
it is a room crowded with memories of the courage and the high aspirations and the high accomplishment of [ p.295 ] the american presidents .
it is a room in which have been marked many of our national triumphs .
the problems of our country today crowd for entry here as they have each day for more than 130 years past .
one problem has been ever constant , with each succeeding president -- that we should maintain and strengthen the will of the nation and other nations for peace .
in this room have been taken those reluctant steps which have led our nation to war and those willing steps which have again led to peace .
never have we had a president who was either a pacifist or a militarist .
never has there been a president who did not pray that his administration might be one of peace , and that peace should be more assured for his successor .
yet these men have never hesitated when war became the duty of the nation .
and always in these years the thought of our presidents has been adequate preparedness for defense as one of the assurances of peace .
but that preparedness must not exceed the barest necessity for defense or it becomes a threat of aggression against others and thus a cause of fear and animosity of the world .
and there are other assurances of peace which have been devised in this room , advanced and supported by our presidents over the past half century .
great aid has been given by them to the advance of conciliation , arbitration , and judicial determination for settlement of international disputes .
these are the steps which prevent war .
lately we and other nations have pledged ourselves never to use war as an instrument of national policy .
and there is another such step which follows with impelling logic from those advances .
that is the reduction of arms .
some months ago i proposed to the world that we should further reduce and limit naval arms .
today we are engaged in a most hopeful discussion with other governments leading to this end .
these are proposals which would preserve our national defenses and yet would relieve the backs of those who toil from gigantic expenditures and the world from the hate and fear which flows from the rivalry in building warships .
and daily in this room do i receive evidence of almost universal prayer that this negotiation shall succeed .
for confidence that there will be peace is the first necessity of human progress .

we are dealing here with a psychological situation to a very considerable degree .
it is a question of fear .
we have had a collapse in the stock market , out of which a good many people have lost money , and a lot of people who could not afford to , and a lot of unfortunate people have been brought in , the effect of which in the american mind creates an undue state of alarm , because our national thinking naturally goes back to previous occasions when events of that character have had a very considerable bearing upon the business situation , and in its final interpretation it is employment .
now , a great many people lifted their standards of living , and naturally the effect of such a thing tends to decrease consumption particularly for luxury and semi - luxury , and those trades are no doubt still affected .
but this occasion so far differs from all others in that the credit situation in the country is entirely isolated from it due to the federal reserve and the banks , and there is no credit consideration involved .
but the natural recovery of increased interest rates by the withdrawal of capital from speculative securities takes that capital ultimately back into industry and commerce .
it is ordinarily the tendency of industrial leaders and everyone else to sit back to see what happens and to be a little more cautious in his business than he might otherwise have been that we have to deal with .
we have also to deal naturally with some unemployment in the semi - necessity trades .
but the real problem and the interpretation of it is one of maintenance of employment .
this is not a question of bolstering stock markets or stock prices or anything of that kind .
we are dealing with the vital question of maintaining employment in the united states and consequently the comfort and standard of living of the people and their ability to buy goods and proceed in the normal course of their lives .
so that the purpose of this movement is to disabuse the public mind of the notion that there has been any serious or vital interruption in our economic system , and that it is going to proceed in the ordinary , normal manner , and to get that impression over not by preachment and talks but by definite and positive acts on the part of industry and business and [ p.388 ] the government and others .
as i said before , i do not believe that words ever convince a discouraged person in these situations .
the thing that brings him back is courage and the natural sight of other industries and other men going ahead with their programs and business .
so i wanted you to get that background upon it all , because it seriously concerns the press to give the confidence to the public that the business fabric is now organizing itself , taking steps on its own responsibility to carry on ; that it is going to go even farther and stretch itself to meet any possible condition of employment is the thing that will give courage to the public rather than to say to them every day that they should not be alarmed .
so that i am trying to get this problem across by action in different industries and other groups rather than by too much talking , and , therefore , i do n't want to talk about it .
i want the action to speak for itself .
these conclusions are not a statement from me .
that is the conclusion of those men who were present .

an emergency has developed in the last few days which it is my duty to lay before the senate .
the continued downward movement in the economic life of the country has been particularly accelerated during the past few days , and it relates in part definitely to the financial program of the government .
there can be no doubt that superimposed upon other causes the long - continued delays in the passage of legislation providing for such reduction in expenses and such addition to revenues as would balance the budget , together with proposals of projects which would greatly increase governmental expenditures , have given rise to doubt and anxiety as to the ability of our government to meet its responsibilities .
these fears and doubts have been foolishly exaggerated in foreign countries .
they know from bitter experience that the course of unbalanced budgets is the road of ruin .
they do not realize that slow as our processes may be we are determined and have the resources to place the finances of the united states on an unassailable basis .
the immediate result has been to create an entirely unjustified run upon the american dollar from foreign countries and within the past few days despite our national wealth and resources and our unparalleled gold reserves our dollar stands at a serious discount in the markets of the world for the first time in half a century .
this can be and must be immediately corrected or the reaction upon our economic situation will be such as to cause great losses to our people and will still further retard recovery .
nor is the confusion in public mind and the rising feeling of doubt and fear confined to foreign countries .
it reflects itself directly in diminished economic activity and increased unemployment within our own borders and among our own citizens .
there is thus further stress upon already diminished and strained economic life of the country .
no one has a more sympathetic realization than i of the difficulties and complexities of the problem with which the congress is confronted .
the decrease in revenues due to the depression by upwards of $ 1,700 million and the consequent necessity to reduce government expenditures , the sacrifice such reduction calls for from many groups and sections , the further sacrifice called for in the distribution of the remaining burden by the imposition of new taxes , all constitute a problem which naturally arouses wide divergence of sectional interest and individual views .
yet if we are to secure a just distribution of these sacrifices in such fashion as to establish confidence in the integrity of the government we must secure an adjustment of these views to quick and prompt national action , directed at one sole purpose , that is to unfetter the rehabilitation of industry , agriculture , and unemployment .
the time has come when we must all make sacrifice of some parts of our particular views and bring these dangers and degenerations to halt by expeditious action .
in the stress of this emergency i have conferred with members of both parties of the senate as to methods by which the strains and stresses could be overcome and the gigantic resources and energies of our people released from the fetters in which they are held .
i have felt in the stress of this emergency a grave responsibility rests upon me not only to present the situation to the senate but to make suggestions as to the basis of adjustment between these views which i hope will lead to early action .
and i am addressing myself to the senate on this occasion as the major questions under consideration are now before this body .
we have three major duties in legislation in order to accomplish our fundamental purposes .
1 .
drastic reduction of expenditures .
2 .
passage of adequate revenue legislation , the combination of which with reductions will unquestionably beyond all manner of doubt declare to the world the balancing of the federal budget and the stabilizing of the american dollar .
3 .
passage of adequate relief legislation to assure the country against distress and to aid in employment pending the next session of congress .
it is essential that when we ask our citizens to undertake the burdens of increased taxation we must give to them evidence of reduction of every expenditure not absolutely vital to the immediate conduct of the government .
the executive budget of last december provided for a reduction of expenditures in the next fiscal year over the then estimated expenditures of the current year by about $ 370 million .
i have recommended to the congress from time to time the necessity for passage of legislation which would give authority for further important reductions in expenditures not possible for consideration by either the executive or the committees of congress without such legislation .
an earnest nonpartisan effort was made to secure these purposes in a national economy bill in the house , but it largely failed .
that subject is under review by the bipartisan committee appointed from the members of the senate appropriations committee , and i am informed it has tentatively agreed upon a recommendation which would aggregate savings of $ 250 million together with a number of undetermined further possibilities .
i am not informed as to details of these recommendations although i learn that my own suggestions in many instances have not been accepted .
but i do know that the committee has made honest and earnest effort to reach a just reduction in expenditures , and i trust therefore that despite any of our individual views or the sacrifice of any group , that we can unite in support and expeditious adoption of the committee 's conclusions .
in addition to the economies which may be brought about through the economy bill , the direct reductions of the appropriations committees should increase this figure to at least $ 400 million not including certain postponements to later deficiency bills .
as this sum forms the basis of calculations as to increased taxes necessary it is essential that , no matter what the details may be , that amount of reduction must be obtained or taxes must be increased to compensate .
if this minimum of $ 400 million is attained by congressional action together with the $ 369 million effected through executive budget , except for amounts already budgeted for public works in aid to unemployment and increased costs of veterans , we will have reduced expenditures of this government to the lowest point since 1916 .
in the matter of tax legislation , we must face the plain and unpalatable fact that due to the degeneration in the economic situation during the past month the estimates of fertility of taxes which have been made from time to time based upon the then current prospects of business must be readjusted to take account of the decreasing business activity and shrinking values .
the finance committee has been advised that the setbacks of the past month now make it evident that if we are to have absolute assurance of the needed income with breadth of base which would make a certainty of the collections we must face additional taxes to those now proposed by the senate finance committee .
i recognize the complaint that estimates of the taxes required and reductions of expenses needed have been repeatedly increased , but on the other hand it should be borne in mind that if tax and economy legislation recommended from time to time since last december had been promptly enacted there would have been less degeneration and stagnation in the country .
but it is unprofitable to argue any such questions .
we must face the situation as it exists today .
in the course of the 6 months during which the revenue bill has been considered in the house and senate practically every form of tax has been suggested at one time or another , many have found their way into the bill later to be rejected .
the total amount congress originally set out to obtain has been gradually whittled down either by actual reductions or degeneration of the situation while needs have increased .
if we examine the major sources of possible increases in taxes now proposed and the nature of taxes already voted , it may well be that the income taxes have already been raised to the point of diminishing returns through avoidance which will ensue by the use of tax - exempt securities and are already so high as to approach the danger point in retardation of enterprise .
it is advisable that more relief should be given to earned incomes .
nor will further increase in income tax , even including the proposals of senator connally , 1 cover the gap in our revenues or provide against any failure to reduce expenses to the full amount i have stated .
the senate has already imposed a multitude of specific manufacturers excise taxes on special industries .
some of them appear discriminatory and uncertain in their productivity .
i have not and do not favor a general sales tax .
it has not been proposed by the treasury .
a sales tax is not , however , to be confused with an extension of the special manufacturers excise taxes to a general manufacturers excise tax with exemptions of food and clothing .
this is an entirely different tax from a so - called sales tax and can not be pyramided .
even this general manufacturers excise tax has not been proposed by the treasury , although at the time such a tax was unanimously recommended by the ways and means committee of the house , representing both political parties and their leaders in the house of representatives , the secretary of the treasury accepted it in the hope that immediate passage of the bill would result .
in order , however , to solve our problem and give assurance to the country and the world of the impregnability of the american dollar and that we are ready to meet our emergencies at any sacrifice , i have now come to favor an extension for a limited period of the many special excise taxes to a more general manufacturers excise tax and will support the congress if it should be adopted .
whether this be the course or not some further emergency tax sources should be incorporated in the pending bill .
1 on may 16 , 1932 , senator tom connally o&#1114 ; texas offered an amendment to the revenue bill providing for income taxes ranging up to 55 percent in the highest bracket .
the senate rejected the amendment on may 17 .
our third problem is that of relief .
the sharp degeneration has its many reflexes in distress and hardship upon our people .
i hold that the maintenance of the sense of individual and personal responsibility of men to their neighbors and the proper separation of functions of the federal and local governments requires the maintenance of the fundamental principle that the obligation of distress rests upon the individuals , upon the communities and upon the states .
in order , however , that there may be no failure on the part of any state to meets its obligation in this direction i have , after consultation with some of the party leaders on both sides , favored authorization to the reconstruction finance corporation to loan up to $ 300 million to state governments where they are unable to finance themselves in provision of relief to distress .
such loans should be made by purchase of state bonds by the corporation but where states are unable to issue bonds then loans should be made upon application of state authorities , and if they are not regularized by the issuance of bonds within a period of 12 to 18 months , they should become a charge upon the federal aid funds to which such states may be entitled .
in order to aid unemployment and to avoid wasteful expansion of public works i have favored an authority to the reconstruction corporation to increase its issues of its securities to the maximum of $ 3 billion in order that it may extend its services both in aid to employment and agriculture on a wide scale .
under the methods proposed the corporation is to be : ( a ) authorized to buy bonds from political subdivisions or public bodies to aid in construction of income - producing or self - liquidating projects ; ( b ) to make loans to established enterprise upon adequate security , for advancement of sound projects that will increase employment but safeguarded by requirement that some portion of outside capital is also provided ; ( c ) to divert a portion of the unexpended authorizations of agricultural loans through the secretary of agriculture to finance exports of agricultural products ; ( d ) to make loans to institutions upon security of agricultural commodities to assure the carrying of normal stocks of these commodities and thus by stabilizing their loan value to steady their price levels ; ( e ) to make loans to the federal farm board to enable extension of finance of farm cooperatives .
i have not been able to favor the expansion of public works beyond the program already proposed in the budget .
i have for many years advocated speeding up of public works as relief to unemployment in times of depression .
since the beginning of this depression , in consonance with this view , the federal government will have expended in excess of $ 1,500 million in construction and maintenance of one kind or another as against a normal program of perhaps $ 650 million for a similar period .
the budget for next year calls for over $ 550 million or double our usual outlay .
if we shall now increase these programs we shall need instantly to increase taxes still further .
we have already forced every project which we have justification with any regard to the taxpayer and the avoidance of sheer waste .
it is not my desire on this occasion to argue the comparative merits of extending such a program and that of financing an even larger program of employment on productive works through the reconstruction finance corporation .
we are indeed all desirous of serving our fellow citizens who are in difficulty and we must serve them in such a fashion that we do not increase the ranks of unemployed .
i may emphasize that this alternative program avoids drain upon the taxpayer , and above all if we are to balance our budget and balance it in such fashion that our people and the world may know it is balanced , we can not make further appropriations in any direction beyond the amounts now before the congress .
i am confident that if the congress could find in these suggestions which come from members of both parties a ground for adjustment of legislation on those dominant particulars and could bring it into immediate action it would yield not only relief to the country but would reestablish that confidence which we so sorely need .
the natural wealth of this country is unimpaired , and the inherent abilities of our people to meet their problems are being restrained by failure of the government to act .
time is of the essence .
every day 's delay makes new wounds and extends them .
i come before you in sympathy with the difficulties which the problem presents and in a sincere spirit of helpfulness .
i ask of you to accept such a basis of practical adjustment essential to the welfare of our people .
in your hands at this moment is the answer to the question whether democracy has the capacity to act speedily enough to save itself in emergency .
the nation urgently needs unity .
it needs solidarity before the world in demonstrating that america has the courage to look its difficulties in the face and the capacity and resolution to meet them .

" i observe that measures have been already introduced in congress and are having advocacy , which , if passed , would impose an increased expenditure beyond the sums which i have recommended for the present and next fiscal year by a total of nearly $ 4,500 million , and mostly under the guise of giving relief of some kind or another .
the gross sums which i have recommended to carry on the essential functions of the government include the extreme sums which can be applied by the federal government in actual emergency employment or relief , and are the maximum which can be financed without increase in taxes .
" no matter how devised , an increase in taxes in the end falls upon the workers and farmers , or alternatively deprives industry of that much ability to give employment and defeats the very purpose of these schemes .
for the government to finance by bond issues deprives industry and agriculture of just that much capital for its own use and for employment .
prosperity can not be restored by raids upon the public treasury .
" the leaders of both parties are cooperating to prevent any such event .
some of these schemes are ill - considered , some represent enthusiasts , and some represent the desire of individuals to show that they are more generous than the administration or that they are more generous than even the leaders of their own parties .
they are playing politics at the expense of human misery .
" many of these measures are being promoted by organizations and agencies outside of congress and being pushed upon members of congress .
some of them are mistaken as to the results they will accomplish and they are all mistaken as to the ability of the federal government to undertake such burdens .
some of these outside agencies are also engaged in promoting political purposes .
the american people will not be misled by such tactics . "

" in my recommendations to congress and in the organizations created during the past few months , there is a definite program for turning the tide of deflation and starting the country upon the road to recovery .
this program has been formulated after consultation with leaders of every branch of american public life , of labor , of agriculture , of commerce , and of industry .
a considerable part of it depends on voluntary organization in the country .
this is already in action .
a part of it requires legislation .
it is a nonpartisan program .
i am interested in its principles rather than its details .
i appeal for unity of action for its consummation .
" the major steps that we must take are domestic .
the action needed is in the home field , and it is urgent .
while reestablishment of stability abroad is helpful to us and to the world , and i am confident that it is in progress , yet we must depend upon ourselves .
if we devote ourselves to these urgent domestic questions we can make a very large measure of recovery irrespective of foreign influences .
" that the country may get this program thoroughly in mind , i review its major parts : 
 " 1 .
provision for distress among the unemployed by voluntary organization and united action of local authorities in cooperation with the president 's unemployment relief organization , whose appeal for organization and funds has met with a response unparalleled since the war .
almost every locality in the country has reported that it will take care of its own .
in order to assure that there will be no failure to meet problems as they arise , the organization will continue through the winter .
" 2 .
our employers are organized and will continue to give part - time work instead of discharging a portion of their employees .
this plan is affording help to several million people who otherwise would have no resources .
the government will continue to aid unemployment over the winter through the large program of federal construction now in progress .
this program represents an expenditure at the rate of over $ 60 million a month .
" 3 .
the strengthening of the federal land bank system in the interest of the farmer .
" 4 .
assistance to homeowners , both agricultural and urban , who are in difficulties in securing renewals of mortgages by strengthening the country banks , savings banks , and building and loan associations through the creation of a system of home loan discount banks .
by restoring these institutions to normal functioning , we will see a revival in employment in new construction .
" 5 .
development of a plan to assure early distribution to depositors in closed banks , and thus relieve distress amongst millions of smaller depositors and smaller businesses .
" 6 .
the enlargement under full safeguards of the discount facilities of the federal reserve banks in the interest of a more adequate credit system .
" 7 .
the creation for the period of the emergency of a reconstruction finance corporation to furnish necessary credit otherwise unobtainable under existing circumstances , and so give confidence to agriculture , to industry and to labor against further paralyzing influences and shocks , but more especially by the reopening of credit channels which will assure the maintenance and normal working of the commercial fabric .
" 8 .
assistance to all railroads by protection from unregulated competition , and to the weaker ones by the formation of a credit pool , as authorized by the interstate commerce commission , and by other measures , thus affording security to the bonds held by our insurance companies , our savings banks , and other benevolent trusts , thereby protecting the interest of every family and promoting the recuperation of the railways .
" 9 .
the revision of our banking laws so as better to safeguard the depositors .
" 10 .
the safeguarding and support of banks through the national credit association , which has already given great confidence to bankers and extended their ability to make loans to commerce and industry .
" 11 .
the maintenance of the public finance on a sound basis : 
 ( a ) by drastic economy .
( b ) resolute opposition to the enlargement of federal expenditure until recovery .
( c ) a temporary increase in taxation , so distributed that the burden may be borne in proportion to ability to pay amongst all groups and in such a fashion as not to retard recovery .
" 12 .
the maintenance of the american system of individual initiative and individual and community responsibility .
" the broad purpose of this program is to restore the old job instead of create a made job , to help the worker at the desk as well as the bench , to restore their buying power for the farmers ' products -- in fact , turn the processes of liquidation and deflation and start the country forward all along the line .
" this program will affect favorably every man , woman and child - not a special class or any group .
one of its purposes is to start the flow of credit now impeded by fear and uncertainty , to the detriment of every manufacturer , business man and farmer .
to reestablish normal functioning is the need of the hour . "

mr. chairman and my fellow citizens : 
 in accepting the great honor that you have brought to me , i desire to speak so simply and so plainly that every man and woman in the united states who may hear or read my words can not misunderstand .
the last 3 years have been a time of unparalleled economic calamity .
they have been years of greater suffering and hardship than any which have come to the american people since the aftermath of the civil war .
as we look back over these troubled years we realize that we have passed through two different stages of dislocation and distress .
before the storm broke we were steadily gaining in prosperity .
our wounds from the war were rapidly healing .
advances in science and invention had opened vast vistas of new progress .
being prosperous , we became optimistic -- all of us .
from optimism some of us went to overexpansion in anticipation of the future , and from overexpansion to reckless speculation .
in the soil poisoned by speculation grew those ugly weeds of waste , exploitation , and abuse of financial power .
in this overproduction and speculative mania we marched with the rest of the whole world .
then 3 years ago came retribution by the inevitable worldwide slump in the consumption of goods , in prices , and employment .
at that juncture it was the normal penalty for a reckless boom such as we have witnessed a score of times in our national history .
through such depressions we have always passed safely after a relatively short period of losses , of hardship , and of adjustment .
we have adopted policies in the government which were fitting to the situation .
gradually the country began to right itself .
eighteen months ago there was a solid basis for hope that recovery was in sight .
then , there came to us a new calamity , a blow from abroad of such dangerous character as to strike at the very safety of the republic .
the countries of europe proved unable to withstand the stress of the depression .
the memories of the world had ignored the fact that the insidious diseases left by the great war had not been cured .
the skill and intelligence of millions in europe had been blotted out by battle , by disease , and by starvation .
stupendous burdens of national debt had been built up .
poisoned springs of political instability lay in the treaties which closed the war .
fear and hates held armament to double those before the great conflict .
governments were fallaciously seeking to build back by enlarged borrowing , by subsidizing industry and employment from taxes that slowly sapped the savings upon which industry and rejuvenated commerce must be built .
under these strains the financial systems of foreign countries crashed one by one .
new blows with decreasing world consumption of goods and from failing financial systems rained upon our people .
we are a part of the world the disturbance of whose remotest populations affects our financial system , our employment , our markets , and the prices of our farm products .
thus beginning 18 months ago , the worldwide storm grew rapidly to hurricane force and the greatest economic emergency in all the history of the world .
unexpected , unforeseen , violent shocks with every month brought new dangers and new emergencies to our country .
fear and apprehension gripped the heart of our people in every village and city .
if we look back over the disasters of these 3 years , we find that three - quarter of the population of the globe has suffered from the flames of revolution .
many nations have been subject to constant change and vacillation of government .
others have resorted to dictatorship or tyranny in desperate attempts to preserve some kind of social order .
i may pause for one short illustration of the character of one single destructive force arising from these causes which we have been compelled to meet .
that was its effect upon our financial structure .
foreign countries , in the face of their own failures , the failures of their neighbors , not believing that we had either the courage or the ability or the strength to meet this crisis , withdrew from the united states over $ 2,400 million , including a billion of gold .
our own alarmed citizens withdrew over $ 1,600 million of currency from our banks into hoarding .
these actions , combined with the fears that they generated , caused a shrinkage of credit available for the conduct of industry and commerce by several times even these vast sums .
its visible expression was the failures of banks and business , the demoralization of security and real property values , of the commodity prices , and of employment .
and that was but one of the invading forces of destruction that we have been compelled to meet in the last 18 months .
two courses were open to us .
we might have done nothing .
that would have been utter ruin .
instead , we met the situation with proposals to private business and to the congress of the most gigantic program of economic defense and counterattack ever evolved in the history of the republic .
we put that program in action .
our measures have repelled these attacks of fear and panic .
we have maintained the financial integrity of the government .
we have cooperated to restore and stabilize the situation abroad .
as a nation we have paid every dollar demanded of us .
we have used the credit of the government to aid and protect our institutions , both public and private .
we have provided methods and assurances that none suffer from hunger or cold amongst our people .
we have instituted measures to assist our farmers and our homeowners .
we have created vast agencies for employment .
above all , we have maintained the sanctity of the principles upon which this republic has grown great .
in a large sense the test of the success of our program is simple .
our people , while suffering great hardships , have been and will be cared for .
in the long view our institutions have been sustained intact and are now functioning with increasing confidence for the future .
as a nation we are undefeated and unafraid .
and again above all , government by the people has not been defiled .
with the humility of one who by necessity has stood in the midst of this storm i can say with pride that the distinction for these accomplishments belongs not to the government or to any individual .
it is due to the intrepid soul of our people .
it is to their character , their fortitude , their initiative , and their courage that we owe these results .
we of this generation did not build this great ship of state .
but the policies that we have inaugurated have protected and aided its navigation in this terrible storm .
these policies and programs have not been partisan .
i gladly give tribute to those members of the democratic party in the congress whose patriotic cooperation against factional and demagogic opposition has assisted in a score of great undertakings .
i likewise give credit to democratic as well as republican leaders among our citizens for their cooperation and their help .
a record of these dangers and these policies of the last 3 years will be set down in the books .
much of it is of interest only to history .
our interest now is in the future .
i dwell upon these policies and these programs and problems only where they illustrate the questions of the day and our course for the future .
as a government and as a people we still have much to do .
we must continue the building of our measures of restoration .
we must profit by the lessons of this experience .
before i enter upon a discussion of these policies i wish to say something of my conception of the relations of our government to the people and the responsibilities of both , particularly as applied to these times .
the spirit and the devising of this government by the people was to sustain a dual purpose -- on the one hand to protect our people amongst nations and in domestic emergencies by great national power , and on the other to preserve individual liberty and freedom through local self - government .
the function of the federal government in these times is to use its reserve powers and its strength for the protection of citizens and local governments by the support to our institutions against forces beyond their control .
it is not the function of the government to relieve individuals of their responsibilities to their neighbors , or to relieve private institutions of their responsibilities to the public , or the local government to the states , or the responsibilities of state governments to the federal government .
in giving that protection and that aid the federal government must insist that all of them exert their responsibilities in full .
it is vital that the programs of the government shall not compete with or replace any of them but shall add to their initiative and to their strength .
it is vital that by the use of public revenues and public credit in emergencies that the nation shall be strengthened and not weakened .
and in all these emergencies and crises , and in all our future policies , we must also preserve the fundamental principles of our social and our economic system .
that system was rounded upon a conception of ordered freedom .
the test of that freedom is that there should be maintained an equality of opportunity to every individual so that he may achieve for himself the best to which his character , ability , and ambition entitle him .
it is only by the release of initiative , this insistence upon individual responsibility , that we accrue the great sums of individual accomplishment which carry this nation forward .
this is not an individualism which permits men to run riot in selfishness or to override equality of opportunity for others .
it permits no violation of ordered liberty .
in the race after false gods of materialism men and groups have forgotten their country .
equality of opportunity contains no conception of exploitation by any selfish , ruthless , class - minded men or groups .
they have no place in the american system .
as against these stand the guiding ideals and the concepts of our nation .
i propose to maintain them .
the solution of our many problems which arise from the shifting scene of national life is not to be found in haphazard experimentation or by revolution .
it must be through organic development of our national life under these ideals .
it must secure that cooperative action which brings initiative and strength outside of the government .
it does not follow , because our difficulties are stupendous , because there are some souls timorous enough to doubt the validity and effectiveness of our ideals and our system , that we must turn to a state - controlled or state - directed social or economic system in order to cure our troubles .
that is not liberalism ; that is tyranny .
it is the regimentation of men under autocratic bureaucracy with all its extinction of liberty , of hope , and of opportunity .
of course , no man of understanding says that our system works perfectly .
it does not for the human race is not yet perfect .
nevertheless , the movement of true civilization is towards freedom rather than regimentation .
and that is our ideal .
ofttimes the tendency of democracy in the presence of national danger is to strike blindly , to listen to demagogues and to slogans , all of which destroy and do not save .
we have refused to be stampeded into such courses .
ofttimes democracy elsewhere in the world has been unable to move fast enough to save itself in emergency .
there have been disheartening delays and failures in legislation and private action which -have added to the losses of our people , yet this democracy of ours has proved its ability to act .
our emergency measures of the last 3 years form a definite strategy dominated in the background by these american principles and ideals , forming a continuous campaign waged against the forces of destruction on an ever - widening and a constantly shifting front .
thus we have held that the federal government should in the presence of great national danger use its powers to give leadership to the initiative , the courage , and the fortitude of the people themselves , but that it must insist upon individual , community , and state responsibility .
that it should furnish leadership to assure the coordination and unity of great existing agencies , governmental and private , for economic and humanitarian action .
that where it becomes necessary to meet emergencies beyond the power of these agencies by the creation of new governmental instrumentalities , that they should be of such character as not to supplant or weaken , but rather to supplement and strengthen , the initiative and enterprise of our people .
that they must , directly or indirectly , serve all of the people .
and above all , that they should be set up in such form that once the emergency is past they can and must be demobilized and withdrawn , leaving our governmental , economic , and social structure strong and whole .
we have not feared boldly to adopt unprecedented measures to meet unprecedented violences of the storm .
but , because we have kept ever before us these eternal principles of our nation , the american government in its ideals is the same as it was when the people gave the presidency to my trust .
we shall keep it so .
we have resolutely rejected the temptation , under pressure of immediate events , to resort to those panaceas and short cuts which , even if temporarily successful , would ultimately undermine and weaken what has slowly been built and molded by experience and effort throughout these 150 years .
it was in accordance with these principles that at the first stage of the depression i called upon the leaders of business and of labor and of agriculture to meet with me and induced them , by their own initiative , to organize against the panic with all its devastating destruction ; to uphold wages until the cost of living was adjusted ; to spread existing employment through shortened hours ; and to advance construction work against future need .
it was in pursuance of that same policy that i have each winter thereafter assumed the leadership in mobilizing all of the voluntary and official organizations throughout the country to prevent suffering from hunger and cold , and to protect millions of families stricken by drought .
and when it became advisable to strengthen the states who could no longer carry the full burden of relief to distress , it was in accordance with these principles that we held that the federal government should do so through loans to the states and thus maintain the fundamental responsibility of the states themselves .
we stopped the attempt to turn this effort to the politics of selfish sectional demands , and we kept it based upon human need .
it was in accordance with these principles that , in aid to unemployment , we expend some $ 600 millions in federal construction of such public works as can be justified as bringing early and definite returns .
we have opposed the distortion of these needed works into pork - barrel nonproductive works which impoverish the nation .
it is in accord with these principles and these purposes that we have made provision for $ 1,500 millions of loans to self - supporting works so that we may increase employment in productive labor .
we rejected projects of wasteful nonproductive work allocated for purposes of attracting votes instead of affording relief .
thereby , instead of wasteful drain upon the taxpayer , we secured the return of their cost to government agencies and at the same time we increased the wealth of the nation .
it was in accordance with these principles that we have strengthened the capital of the federal land banks -- that , on the one hand , confidence in their securities should not be impaired , and that on the other , the farmers indebted to them should not be unduly deprived of their homes .
it was in accordance with these purposes that the farm board by emergency loan to farmers ' cooperatives served to stem panics in agricultural prices and saved hundreds of thousands of farmers and their creditors from bankruptcy .
it was in accord with these ideas that we have created agencies to prevent bankruptcy and failure in their cooperative organizations ; that we are erecting new instrumentalities to give credit facilities for their livestock growers and their orderly marketing of their farm products .
it is in accordance with these principles that in the face of the looming european crises we sought to change the trend of european economic degeneration by our proposals of the german moratorium and the standstill agreements on german private debts .
we stemmed the tide of collapse in germany and the consequent ruin of its people .
in furtherance of world stability we have made proposals to reduce the cost of world armaments by $ 1 billion a year .
it was in accordance with these principles that i first secured the creation by private initiative of the national credit association , whose efforts prevented the failure of hundreds of banks , and the loss to countless thousands of depositors who had loaned all of their savings to them .
it was in accord with these ideas that as the storm grew in intensity we created the reconstruction finance corporation with a capital of 2 billions more to uphold the credit structure of the nation , and by thus raising the shield of government credit we prevented the wholesale failure of banks , of insurance companies , of building and loan associations , of farm mortgage associations , and of railroads in all of which the public interest is paramount .
this disaster has been averted through the saving of more than 5,000 institutions and the knowledge that adequate assistance was available to tide others over the stress .
this has been done not to save a few stockholders , but to save 25 millions of american families , every one of whose very savings and employment might have been wiped out and whose whole future would have been blighted had these institutions gone down .
it was in accordance with these principles that we expanded the functions and the powers of the federal reserve banks that they might counteract the stupendous shrinkage of credit due to fear and to hoarding and the foreign withdrawal of our resources .
it was in accordance with these principles that we are now in process of establishing a new system of home loan banks so that through added strength and through cooperation between the building and loan associations , the savings banks and other institutes we may relax the pressures on forfeiture of homes and procure the release of new resources for the construction of more homes and the employment of more men .
it was in accordance with these principles that we have insisted upon a reduction of governmental expenses , for no country can squander itself to prosperity on the ruins of its taxpayers .
and it was in accordance with these purposes that we have sought new revenues to equalize the diminishing income of the government in order that the power of the federal government to meet the emergency should be impregnable .
it was in accordance with these principles that we have joined in the development of a world economic conference to bulwark the whole international fabric of finance , of monetary values , and the expansion of world commerce .
it was in accordance with these principles and these policies that i am today organizing the private industrial and financial resources of the country to cooperate effectively with the vast governmental instrumentalities which we have in motion , so that through their united and coordinated efforts we may move from defense to a powerful attack upon the depression along the whole national front .
these programs , unparalleled in the history of depressions of any country and in any time , to care for distress , to provide employment , to aid agriculture , to maintain the financial stability of the country , to safeguard the savings of the people , to protect their homes , are not in the past tense -- they are in action .
i shall propose such other measures , public and private , as may be necessary from time to time to meet the changing situations that may occur and to further speed our economic recovery .
that recovery may be slow , but we shall succeed .
and come what may , i shall maintain through all these measures the sanctity of the great principles under which the republic over a period of 150 years has grown to be the greatest nation of the earth .
i should like to digress a second for an observation on the last 3 years which should exhilarate the faith of every american -- and that is the profound growth of the sense of social responsibility in our nation which this depression has demonstrated .
no government in washington has hitherto considered that it held so broad a responsibility for leadership in such times .
despite hardships , the devotion of our men and women to those in distress is demonstrated by the national averages of infant mortality , general mortality , and sickness , which are less today than in times even of prosperity .
for the first time in the history of depressions , dividends and profits and the cost of living have been reduced before wages have been sacrificed .
we have been more free from industrial conflict through strikes and lockouts and all forms of social disorder than even in normal times .
the nation is building the initiative of men and of women toward new fields of social cooperation and new fields of endeavor .
so much for the great national emergency and the principles of government for which we stand and their application to the measures we have taken .
there are national policies wider than the emergency , wider than the economic horizon .
they are set forth in our platform .
having had the responsibility of this office , my views upon most of them are clearly and often set forth in public record .
i may , however , summarize some of them .
first : i am squarely for a protective tariff .
i am against the proposal of " a competitive tariff for revenue " as advocated by our opponents .
that would place our farmers and our workers in competition with peasant and sweated - labor products from abroad .
second : i am against their proposals to destroy the usefulness of the bipartisan tariff commission , the establishment of whose effective powers we secured during this administration just 25 years after it was first advocated by president theodore roosevelt .
that instrumentality enables us to correct any injustice and to readjust the rates of duty to shifting economic change , without constant tinkering and orgies of logrolling by congress .
if our opponents will descend from the vague generalization to any particular schedule , if it be higher than necessary to protect our people or insufficient for their protection , it can be remedied by this bipartisan commission without a national election .
third : my views in opposition to the cancellation of the war debt are a matter of detailed record in many public statements and in a recent message to the congress .
they mark a continuity of that policy maintained by my predecessors .
i am hopeful of such drastic reduction of world armament as will save the taxpayers in debtor countries a large part of the cost of their payments to us .
if for any particular annual payment we were offered some other tangible form of compensation , such as the expansion of markets for american agriculture and labor , and the restoration and maintenance of our prosperity , then i am sure our citizens would consider such a proposal .
but it is a certainty that these debts must not be canceled or these burdens transferred to the backs of the american people .
fourth : i insist upon an army and navy of a strength which guarantees that no foreign soldier will land upon the american soil .
that strength is relative to other nations .
i favor every arms reduction which preserves that relationship .
i favor rigidly restricted immigration .
i have by executive direction in order to relieve us of added unemployment , already reduced the inward movement to less than the outward movement .
i shall adhere to that policy .
sixth : i have repeatedly recommended to the congress a revision of railway transportation laws , in order that we may create greater stability and greater assurance of that vital service in our transportation .
i shall persist in it .
i have repeatedly recommended the federal regulation of interstate power .
i shall persist in that .
i have opposed the federal government undertaking the operation of the power business .
i shall continue in that opposition .
i have for years supported the conservation of national resources .
i have made frequent recommendations to the congress in respect thereto , including legislation to correct the waste and destruction of these resources through the present interpretations of the antitrust laws .
i shall continue to urge such action .
this depression has exposed many weaknesses in our economic system .
there has been exploitation and abuse of financial power .
we will fearlessly and unremittingly reform these abuses .
i have recommended to the congress the reform of our banking laws .
unfortunately this legislation has not yet been enacted .
the american people must have protection from insecure banking through a stronger banking system .
they must be relieved from conditions which permit the credit machinery of the country to be made available without check for wholesale speculation in securities with ruinous consequence to millions of our citizens and to our national economy .
i have recommended to congress methods of emergency relief to the depositors of closed banks .
for 7 years i have repeatedly warned against private loans abroad for nonproductive purposes .
i shall persist in all those matters .
i have insisted upon a balanced budget as the foundation of all public and private financial stability and of all public confidence .
i shall insist on the maintenance of that policy .
recent increases in revenues , while temporary , should be again examined , and if they tend to sap the vitality of industry , and thus retard employment , they should be revised .
the first necessity of the nation , the wealth and income of whose citizens has been reduced , is to reduce the expenditures on government - national , state , and local .
it is in the relief of taxes from the backs of men through which we liberate their powers .
it is through lower expenditures that we get lower taxes .
this must be done .
a considerable reduction in federal expenditures has been attained .
if we except those extraordinary expenditures imposed upon us by the depression , it will be found that the federal government is operating some $ 200 million less annually today than 4 years ago .
the congress rejected recommendations from the administration which would have saved an additional $ 150 million this fiscal year .
the opposition leadership insisted , as the price of vital reconstruction legislation and over the protest of our leaders , upon adding $ 300 million of costs to the taxpayer through public works inadvisable at this time .
i shall repeat these proposals for economy .
the opposition leadership in the house of representatives in the last 4 months secured the passage by that house of $ 3 billion in raids upon the public treasury .
they have been stopped , and i shall continue to oppose such raids .
i have repeatedly for 7 years urged the congress either themselves to abolish obsolete bureaus and commissions and to reorganize the whole government structure in the interest of economy , or to give someone the authority to do it .
i have succeeded partially in securing that authority , but i regret that no great act under it can be effective until after the approval of the next congress .
with the collapse of world prices and the depreciated currencies the farmer was never so dependent upon his tariff protection for recovery as he is at the present time .
we shall hold to that as a national policy .
we have enacted many measures of emergency relief to agriculture .
they are having their effect .
i shall keep them functioning until the strain is past .
the original purpose of the farm board was to strengthen the efforts of the farmer to establish his own farmer - owned , farmer controlled marketing agencies .
it has greatly succeeded in this purpose , even in these times of adversity .
the departure of the farm board from its original purpose by making loans to farmers ' cooperatives to preserve prices from panic served an emergency , but such an action in normal times is absolutely destructive of the farmers ' own interest .
we still have vast problems to solve in agriculture .
but no power on earth can restore prices except by restoration of the general recovery and by restoration of markets .
every measure that we have taken looking to general recovery is of benefit to the farmer .
there is no relief to the farmer by extending governmental bureaucracy to control his production and thus to curtail his liberties , nor by subsidies that bring only more bureaucracy and their ultimate collapse .
and i shall continue to oppose 
 them .
the most practicable relief to the farmer today aside from general economic recovery is a definite program of readjustment and coordination of national , state , and local taxation which will relieve real property , especially the farms , from the unfair burdens of taxation which the current readjustment in values have brought about .
to that purpose i propose to devote myself .
i have always favored the development of rivers and harbors and highways .
these improvements have been greatly expedited in the last 30 years .
we shall continue that work to completion .
after 20 years of discussion between the united states and our great neighbor to the north , i have signed a treaty for the construction of the great lakes - st .
lawrence seaway .
that treaty does not injure the chicago to the gulf waterway , the work upon which , together with the whole mississippi system , i have expedited , and in which i am equally interested .
we shall undertake this great seaway , the greatest public improvement ever undertaken upon our continent , with its consequent employment of men as quickly as that treaty can be ratified .
our views upon sound currency require no elucidation .
they are indelibly a part of republican history and policies .
we have affirmed them by preventing the democratic majority in the house from effecting wild schemes of uncontrolled inflation in the last 4 months .
there are many other important subjects set forth in the platform and in my public statements in the past for which i will not take your time .
there are one or two others that do merit some emphasis .
the leadership of the federal government is not to be confined to economic and international questions .
there are problems of the home and the education of children and of citizenship .
they are the most vital of all to the future of the nation .
except in the case of aids to states which i have recommended for stimulation of the protection and health of children , they are not matters of legislation .
we have given leadership to the initiative of our people for social advancement through this organization against illiteracy , through the white house conferences on the protection and health of children , through the national conferences on homeownership , through the stimulation of social and recreational agencies .
these are the visible evidences of spiritual leadership in the government .
they will be continued , and they will be constantly invigorated .
my foreign policies have been devoted to strengthening the foundations of world peace .
we inaugurated the london naval treaty which reduced arms and limited the ratios between the fleets of the three powers .
we have made concrete proposals at geneva to reduce the armaments of the world by one - third .
it would save the taxpayers of the world a billion a year .
we could save ourselves 200 millions a year .
it would reduce fear and danger of war .
we have expanded the arbitration of disputes .
i have recommended joining the world court under proper reservations preserving our freedom of action .
above all , we have given leadership in the transforming of the kellogg - briand pact from an inspiring outlawry of war to an organized instrument for peaceful settlements backed by definite mobilized world public opinion against aggression .
we shall , under the spirit of that pact , consult with other nations in time of emergency to promote world peace .
we shall enter into no agreements committing us to any future course of action or which call for use of force in order to preserve peace .
i have projected a new doctrine into international affairs -- the doctrine that we do not and never will recognize title to the possession of territory gained in violation of the peace pacts which were signed with us .
that doctrine has been accepted by all the nations of the world on a recent critical occasion , and within the last few days has been again accepted by all the nations of the western hemisphere .
that is public opinion made tangible and effective .
the world needs peace .
it must have peace with justice .
i shall continue to strive unceasingly , with every power of mind and spirit , to explore every possible path that leads towards a world in which right triumphs over force , in which reason rules over passion , in which men and women may rear their children not to be devoured by war but to pursue in safety the nobler arts of peace .
i shall continue to build upon these designs .
across the path of the nation 's consideration of these vast problems of economic and social order there has arisen a bitter controversy over the control of the liquor traffic .
i have always sympathized with the high purpose of the 18th amendment , and i have used every power at my command to make it effective over this entire country .
i have hoped that it was the final solution of the evils of the liquor traffic against which our people have striven for generations .
it has succeeded in great measure in those many communities where the majority sentiment is favorable to it .
but in other and increasing numbers of communities there is a majority sentiment unfavorable to it .
laws which are opposed by the majority sentiment create resentments which undermine enforcement and in the end produce degeneration and crime .
our opponents pledge the members of their party to destroy every vestige of constitutional and effective federal control of the traffic .
that means that over large areas the return of the saloon system with its corruption , its moral and social abuse which debauched the home , its deliberate interference with the states endeavoring to find honest solution , its permeation of political parties , its perversion of legislatures , which reached even to the capital of the nation .
the 18th amendment smashed that regime as by a stroke of lightning .
i can not consent to the return of that system again .
we must recognize the difficulties which have developed in making the 18th amendment effective and that grave abuses have grown up .
in order to secure the enforcement of the amendment under our dual form of government , the constitutional provision called for concurrent action on one hand by the state and local authorities and on the other by the federal government .
its enforcement requires , therefore , independent but coincident action of both agencies .
an increasing number of states and municipalities are proving themselves unwilling to engage in that enforcement .
due to these forces there is in large sections increasing illegal traffic in liquor .
but worse than this there has been in those areas a spread of disrespect not only for this law but for all laws , grave dangers of practical nullification of the constitution , an increase in subsidized crime and violence .
i can not consent to a continuation of that regime .
i refuse to accept either of these destinies , on the one hand to return to the old saloon with its political and social corruption , or on the other to endure the bootlegger and the speakeasy with their abuses and crime .
either of them are intolerable , and they are not the only ways out .
now , our objective must be a sane solution , not a blind leap back to old evils .
moreover , a step backwards would result in a chaos of new evils not yet experienced , because the local systems of prohibition and controls which were developed over generations have been in a large degree abandoned under this amendment .
the republican platform recommends submission of the question to the states and that the people themselves may determine whether they desire a change , but insists that this submission shall propose a constructive and not a destructive change .
it does not dictate to the conscience of any member of the party .
the first duty of the president of the united states is to enforce the laws as they exist .
that i shall continue to do to the best of my ability .
any other course would be the abrogation of the very guarantees of liberty itself .
now , the constitution gives the president no power or authority with respect to changes in the constitution itself ; nevertheless , my countrymen have a right to know my conclusions upon this question .
they are based upon the broad facts that i have stated , upon my experience in this high office , and upon my deep conviction that our purpose must be the elimination of the evils of this traffic from this civilization by practical measures .
it is my belief that in order to remedy present evils a change is necessary by which we resummon a proper share of initiative and responsibility which the very essence of our government demands shall rest upon the states and the local authorities .
that change must avoid the return of the saloon .
it is my conviction that the nature of this change , and one upon which all reasonable people can find common ground , is that each state shall be given the right to deal with the problem as it may determine , but subject to the absolute guarantees in the constitution of the united states to protect each state from interference and invasion by its neighbors , and that in no part of the united states shall there be a return of the saloon system with its inevitable political and social corruption and its organized interference with other states and other communities .
american statesmanship is capable of working out such a solution and making it effective .
my fellow citizens , the discussion of great problems of economic life and of government seem abstract and cold .
but within their right solution lies the happiness and the hope of a great people .
without such solution all else is mere verbal sympathy .
today millions of our fellow countrymen are out of work .
prices of farmers ' products are below a living standard .
many millions more who are in business or hold employment are haunted by fears for the future .
no man with a spark of humanity can sit in my place without suffering from the picture of their anxieties and hardships before him day and night .
they would be more than human if they were not led to blame their condition upon the government in power .
i have understood their sufferings and have worked to the limits of my strength to produce action that would be of help to them .
much remains to be done to attain recovery .
we have had a great and unparalleled shock .
the emergency measures now in action represent an unparalleled use of national power to relieve distress , to provide employment , to serve agriculture , to preserve the stability of the government , and to maintain the integrity of our institutions .
our policies prevent unemployment caused by floods of imported goods and of laborers .
our policies preserve peace in the world .
they embrace cooperation with other nations in those fields in which we can serve .
with patience and perseverance these measures will succeed .
despite the dislocation of economic life our great tools of production and distribution are more efficient than ever before ; our fabulous national resources , our farms and homes and our skill are unimpaired .
from the hard - won experience of this depression we shall build stronger methods of prevention and stronger methods of protection to our people from abuses that have become evident .
we shall march to a far greater accomplishment .
with the united effort we can and will turn the tide towards the restoration of business , of employment , and of agriculture .
it does call for the utmost devotion and the utmost wisdom .
every reserve of american courage and vision must be called upon to sustain us and to plan wisely for the future .
through it all our first duty is to preserve unfettered that dominant american spirit which has produced our enterprise and our individual character .
that is the bedrock of the past , and it is the sole guarantee of the future .
not regimented mechanisms but free men are our goal .
herein is the fundamental issue .
a representative democracy , progressive and unafraid to meet its problems , but meeting them upon the foundations of experience and not upon the wave of emotion or the insensate demands of a radicalism which grasps at every opportunity to exploit the sufferings of a people .
with these courses we shall emerge from this great national strain with our american system of life and government strengthened .
our people will be free to reassert their energy and their enterprise in a society eager to reward in full measure those whose industry serves its well - being .
our youth will find the doors of equal opportunity still open .
the problems of the next few years are not only economic .
they are also moral and spiritual .
the present check to our material success must deeply stir our national conscience upon the purposes of life itself .
it must cause us to revalue and reshape our drift from materialism to a higher note of individual and national ideals .
underlying every purpose is the spiritual application of moral ideals which are the fundamental basis of the happiness of a people .
this is a land of homes and of churches and schoolhouses dedicated to the sober and enduring satisfactions of family life and the rearing of children in an atmosphere of ideals and of religious faith .
only with those ideals and those high standards can we hold society together , and only from them can government survive and business prosper .
they are the sole insurance to the safety of our children and to the continuity of the nation .
if it shall appear that while i have had the honor of the presidency that i have contributed to the part required from this high office to bringing the republic through this dark night , and if in my administration we shall see the break of dawn of the better day , i shall have done my part in the world .
no man can have a greater honor than that .
i have but one desire : that is , to see my country again on the road to prosperity which shall be more sane and lasting through the lessons of this experience , to see the principles and ideals of the american people perpetuated .
i rest the case of the republican party upon the intelligence and the just discernment of the american people .
should my countrymen again place upon me the responsibilities of this high office , i shall carry forward the work of reconstruction .
i shall hope long before another 4 years have passed to see the world prosperous and at peace and every american home again in the sunshine of genuine progress and of genuine prosperity .
i shall seek to maintain untarnished and unweakened those fundamental traditions and principles upon which our nation was rounded , upon which it has grown .
i shall invite and welcome the help of every man and woman in the preservation of the united states for the happiness of its people .
this is my pledge to the nation and my pledge to the almighty god .

to the senate and house of representatives : 
 i have the honor to comply with the requirement of the constitution that i should lay before the congress information as to the state of the union , and recommend consideration of such measures as are necessary and expedient .
substantial progress has been made during the year in national peace and security ; the fundamental strength of the nation 's economic life is unimpaired ; education and scientific discovery have made advances ; our country is more alive to its problems of moral and spiritual welfare .
during the past 12 months we have suffered with other nations from economic depression .
the origins of this depression lie to some extent within our own borders through a speculative period which diverted capital and energy into speculation rather than constructive enterprise .
had overspeculation in securities been the only force operating , we should have seen recovery many months ago , as these particular dislocations have generally readjusted themselves .
other deep - seated causes have been in action , however , chiefly the world - wide overproduction beyond even the demand of prosperous times for such important basic commodities as wheat , rubber , coffee , sugar , copper , silver , zinc , to some extent cotton , and other raw materials .
the cumulative effects of demoralizing price falls of these important commodities in the process of adjustment of production to world consumption have produced financial crises in many countries and have diminished the buying power of these countries for imported goods to a degree which extended the difficulties farther afield by creating unemployment in all the industrial nations .
the political agitation in asia ; revolutions in south america and political unrest in some european states ; the methods of sale by russia of her increasing agricultural exports to european markets ; and our own drought -- have all contributed to prolong and deepen the depression .
in the larger view the major forces of the depression now lie outside of the united states , and our recuperation has been retarded by the unwarranted degree of fear and apprehension created by these outside forces .
the extent of the depression is indicated by the following approximate percentages of activity during the past three months as compared with the highly prosperous year of 1928 : 
 value of department - store sales 93 % of 1928 
 volume of manufacturing production 80 % of 1928 
 volume of mineral production 90 % of 1928 
 volume of factory employment 84 % of 1928 
 total of bank deposits 105 % of 1928 
 wholesale prices -- all commodities 83 % of 1928 
 cost of living 94 % of 1928 
 various other indexes indicate total decrease of activity from 1928 of from 15 to 20 per cent .
there are many factors which give encouragement for the future .
the fact that we are holding from 80 to 85 per cent of our normal activities and incomes ; that our major financial and industrial institutions have come through the storm unimpaired ; that price levels of major commodities have remained approximately stable for some time ; that a number of industries are showing signs of increasing demand ; that the world at large is readjusting itself to the situation ; all reflect grounds for confidence .
we should remember that these occasions have been met many times before , that they are but temporary , that our country is to - day stronger and richer in resources , in equipment , in skill , than ever in its history .
we are in an extraordinary degree self - sustaining , we will overcome world influences and will lead the march of prosperity as we have always done hitherto .
economic depression can not be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement .
economic wounds must be healed by the action of the cells of the economic body -- the producers and consumers themselves .
recovery can be expedited and its effects mitigated by cooperative action .
that cooperation requires that every individual should sustain faith and courage ; that each should maintain his self - reliance ; that each and every one should search for methods of improving his business or service ; that the vast majority whose income is unimpaired should not hoard out of fear but should pursue their normal living and recreations ; that each should seek to assist his neighbors who may be less fortunate ; that each industry should assist its own employees ; that each community and each state should assume its full responsibilities for organization of employment and relief of distress with that sturdiness and independence which built a great nation .
our people are responding to these impulses in remarkable degree .
the best contribution of government lies in encouragement of this voluntary cooperation in the community .
the government , national , state , and local , can join with the community in such programs and do its part .
a year ago i , together with other officers of the government , initiated extensive cooperative measures throughout the country .
the first of these measures was an agreement of leading employers to maintain the standards of wages and of labor leaders to use their influence against strife .
in a large sense these undertakings have been adhered to and we have not witnessed the usual reductions of wages which have always heretofore marked depressions .
the index of union wage scales shows them to be today fully up to the level of any of the previous three years .
in consequence the buying power of the country has been much larger than would otherwise have been the case .
of equal importance the nation has had unusual peace in industry and freedom from the public disorder which has characterized previous depressions .
the second direction of cooperation has been that our governments , national , state , and local , the industries and business so distribute employment as to give work to the maximum number of employees .
the third direction of cooperation has been to maintain and even extend construction work and betterments in anticipation of the future .
it has been the universal experience in previous depressions that public works and private construction have fallen off rapidly with the general tide of depression .
on this occasion , however , the increased authorization and generous appropriations by the congress and the action of states and municipalities have resulted in the expansion of public construction to an amount even above that in the most prosperous years .
in addition the cooperation of public utilities , railways , and other large organizations has been generously given in construction and betterment work in anticipation of future need .
the department of commerce advises me that as a result , the volume of this type of construction work , which amounted to roughly $ 6,300,000,000 in 1929 , instead of decreasing will show a total of about $ 7,000,000,000 for 1930 .
there has , of course , been a substantial decrease in the types of construction which could not be undertaken in advance of need .
the fourth direction of cooperation was the organization in such states and municipalities , as was deemed necessary , of committees to organize local employment , to provide for employment agencies , and to effect relief of distress .
the result of magnificent cooperation throughout the country has been that actual suffering has been kept to a minimum during the past 12 months , and our unemployment has been far less in proportion than in other large industrial countries .
some time ago it became evident that unemployment would continue over the winter and would necessarily be added to from seasonal causes and that the savings of workpeople would be more largely depleted .
we have as a nation a definite duty to see that no deserving person in our country suffers from hunger or cold .
i therefore set up a more extensive organization to stimulate more intensive cooperation throughout the country .
there has been a most gratifying degree of response , from governors , mayors , and other public officials , from welfare organizations , and from employers in concerns both large and small .
the local communities through their voluntary agencies have assumed the duty of relieving individual distress and are being generously supported by the public .
the number of those wholly out of employment seeking for work was accurately determined by the census last april as about 2,500,000 .
the department of labor index of employment in the larger trades shows some decrease in employment since that time .
the problem from a relief point of view is somewhat less than the published estimates of the number of unemployed would indicate .
the intensive community and individual efforts in providing special employment outside the listed industries are not reflected in the statistical indexes and tend to reduce such published figures .
moreover , there is estimated to be a constant figure at all times of nearly 1,000,000 unemployed who are not without annual income but temporarily idle in the shift from one job to another .
we have an average of about three breadwinners to each two families , so that every person unemployed does not represent a family without income .
the view that the relief problems are less than the gross numbers would indicate is confirmed by the experience of several cities , which shows that the number of families in distress represents from 10 to 20 per cent of the number of the calculated unemployed .
this is not said to minimize the very real problem which exists but to weigh its actual proportions .
as a contribution to the situation the federal government is engaged upon the greatest program of waterway , harbor , flood control , public building , highway , and airway improvement in all our history .
this , together with loans to merchant shipbuilders , improvement of the navy and in military aviation , and other construction work of the government will exceed $ 520,000,000 for this fiscal year .
this compares with $ 253,000,000 in the fiscal year 1928 .
the construction works already authorized and the continuation of policies in government aid will require a continual expenditure upwards of half a billion dollars annually .
i favor still further temporary expansion of these activities in aid to unemployment during this winter .
the congress will , however , have presented to it numbers of projects , some of them under the guise of , rather than the reality of , their usefulness in the increase of employment during the depression .
there are certain commonsense limitations upon any expansions of construction work .
the government must not undertake works that are not of sound economic purpose and that have not been subject to searching technical investigation , and which have not been given adequate consideration by the congress .
the volume of construction work in the government is already at the maximum limit warranted by financial prudence as a continuing policy .
to increase taxation for purposes of construction work defeats its own purpose , as such taxes directly diminish employment in private industry .
again any kind of construction requires , after its authorization , a considerable time before labor can be employed in which to make engineering , architectural , and legal preparations .
our immediate problem is the increase of employment for the next six months , and new plans which do not produce such immediate result or which extend commitments beyond this period are not warranted .
the enlarged rivers and harbors , public building , and highway plans authorized by the congress last session , however , offer an opportunity for assistance by the temporary acceleration of construction of these programs even faster than originally planned , especially if the technical requirements of the laws which entail great delays could be amended in such fashion as to speed up acquirements of land and the letting of contracts .
with view , however , to the possible need for acceleration , we , immediately upon receiving those authorities from the congress five months ago , began the necessary technical work in preparation for such possible eventuality .
i have canvassed the departments of the government as to the maximum amount that can be properly added to our present expenditure to accelerate all construction during the next six months , and i feel warranted in asking the congress for an appropriation of from $ 100,000,000 to $ 150,000,000 to provide such further employment in this emergency .
in connection therewith we need some authority to make enlarged temporary advances of federal - highway aid to the states .
i recommend that this appropriation be made distributable to the different departments upon recommendation of a committee of the cabinet and approval by the president .
its application to works already authorized by the congress assures its use in directions of economic importance and to public welfare .
such action will imply an expenditure upon construction of all kinds of over $ 650,000,000 during the next twelve months .
the world - wide depression has affected agriculture in common with all other industries .
the average price of farm produce has fallen to about 80 per cent of the levels of 1928 .
this average is , however , greatly affected by wheat and cotton , which have participated in world - wide overproduction and have fallen to about 60 per cent of the average price of the year 1928 .
excluding these commodities , the prices of all other agricultural products are about 84 per cent of those of 1928 .
the average wholesale prices of other primary goods , such as nonferrous metals , have fallen to 76 per cent of 1928 .
the price levels of our major agricultural commodities are , in fact , higher than those in other principal producing countries , due to the combined result of the tariff and the operations of the farm board .
for instance , wheat prices at minneapolis are about 30 per cent higher than at winnipeg , and at chicago they are about 20 per cent higher than at buenos aires .
corn prices at chicago are over twice as high as at buenos aires .
wool prices average more than 80 per cent higher in this country than abroad , and butter is 30 per cent higher in new york city than in copenhagen .
aside from the misfortune to agriculture of the world - wide depression we have had the most severe drought .
it has affected particularly the states bordering on the potomac , ohio , and lower mississippi rivers , with some areas in montana , kansas , oklahoma , and texas .
it has found its major expression in the shortage of pasturage and a shrinkage in the corn crop from an average of about 2,800,000,000 bushels to about 2,090,000,000 bushels .
on august 14 i called a conference of the governors of the most acutely affected states , and as a result of its conclusions i appointed a national committee comprising the heads of the important federal agencies under the chairmanship of the secretary of agriculture .
the governors in turn have appointed state committees representative of the farmers , bankers , business men , and the red cross , and subsidiary committees have been established in most of the acutely affected counties .
railway rates were reduced on feed and livestock in and out of the drought areas , and over 50,000 cars of such products have been transported under these reduced rates .
the red cross established a preliminary fund of $ 5,000,000 for distress relief purposes and established agencies for its administration in each county .
of this fund less than $ 500,000 has been called for up to this time as the need will appear more largely during the winter .
the federal farm loan board has extended its credit facilities , and the federal farm board has given financial assistance to all affected cooperatives .
in order that the government may meet its full obligation toward our countrymen in distress through no fault of their own , i recommend that an appropriation should be made to the department of agriculture to be loaned for the purpose of seed and feed for animals .
its application should as hitherto in such loans be limited to a gross amount to any one individual , and secured upon the crop .
the red cross can relieve the cases of individual distress by the sympathetic assistance of our people .
i shall submit the detailed financial position of the government with recommendations in the usual budget message .
i will at this time , however , mention that the budget estimates of receipts and expenditures for the current year were formulated by the treasury and the budget bureau at a time when it was impossible to forecast the severity of the business depression and have been most seriously affected by it .
at that time a surplus of about $ 123,000,000 was estimated for this fiscal year and tax reduction which affected the fiscal year to the extent of $ 75,000,000 was authorized by the congress , thus reducing the estimated surplus to about $ 48,000,000 .
closely revised estimates now made by the treasury and the bureau of the budget of the tax , postal , and other receipts for the current fiscal year indicate a decrease of about $ 430,000,000 from the estimate of a year ago , of which about $ 75,000,000 is due to tax reduction , leaving about $ 355,000,000 due to the depression .
moreover , legislation enacted by congress subsequent to the submission of the budget enlarging federal construction work to expand employment and for increase in veterans ' services and other items , have increased expenditures during the current fiscal year by about $ 225,000,000 .
thus the decrease of $ 430,000,000 in revenue and the increase of $ 225,000,000 in expenditure adversely change the original budget situation by about $ 655,000,000 .
this large sum is offset by the original estimated surplus a year ago of about $ 123,000,000 , by the application of $ 185,000,000 of interest payments upon the foreign debt to current expenditures , by arrangements of the farm board through repayments , etc . ,
in consequence of which they reduced their net cash demands upon the treasury by $ 100,000,000 in this period , and by about $ 67,000,000 economies and deferments brought about in the government , thus reducing the practical effect of the change in the situation to an estimated deficit of about $ 180,000,000 for the present fiscal year .
i shall make suggestions for handling the present - year deficit in the budget message , but i do not favor encroachment upon the statutory reduction of the public debt .
while it will be necessary in public interest to further increase expenditures during the current fiscal year in aid to unemployment by speeding up construction work and aid to the farmers affected by the drought , i can not emphasize too strongly the absolute necessity to defer any other plans for increase of government expenditures .
the budget for 1932 fiscal year indicates estimated expenditure of about $ 4,054,000,000 , including postal deficit .
the receipts are estimated at about $ 4,085,000,000 if the temporary tax reduction of last year be discontinued , leaving a surplus of only about $ 30,000,000 .
most rigid economy is therefore necessary to avoid increase in taxes .
our army and navy are being maintained at a high state of efficiency , under officers of high training and intelligence , supported by a devoted personnel of the rank and file .
the london naval treaty has brought important economies in the conduct of the navy .
the navy department will lay before the committees of the congress recommendations for a program of authorization of new construction which should be initiated in the fiscal year of 1932 .
this is the last session of the seventy - first congress .
during its previous sittings it has completed a very large amount of important legislation , notably : the establishment of the federal farm board ; fixing congressional reapportionment ; revision of the tariff , including the flexible provisions and a reorganization of the tariff commission ; reorganization of the radio commission ; reorganization of the federal power commission ; expansion of federal prisons ; reorganization of parole and probation system in federal prisons ; expansion of veterans ' hospitals ; establishment of disability allowances to veterans ; consolidation of veteran activities ; consolidation and strengthening of prohibition enforcement activities in the department of justice ; organization of a narcotics bureau ; large expansion of rivers and harbors improvements ; substantial increase in federal highways ; enlargement of public buildings construction program ; and the ratification of the london naval treaty .
the congress has before it legislation partially completed in the last sitting in respect to muscle shoals , bus regulation , relief of congestion in the courts , reorganization of border patrol in prevention of smuggling , law enforcement in the district of columbia , and other subjects .
it is desirable that these measures should be completed .
the short session does not permit of extensive legislative programs , but there are a number of questions which , if time does not permit action , i recommend should be placed in consideration by the congress , perhaps through committees cooperating in some instances with the federal departments , with view to preparation for subsequent action .
among them are the following subjects : 

 i have in a previous message recommended effective regulation of interstate electrical power .
such regulation should preserve the independence and responsibility of the states .
we have determined upon a national policy of consolidation of the railways as a necessity of more stable and more economically operated transportation .
further legislation is necessary to facilitate such consolidation .
in the public interest we should strengthen the railways that they may meet our future needs .
i recommend that the congress institute an inquiry into some aspects of the economic working of these laws .
i do not favor repeal of the sherman act .
the prevention of monopolies is of most vital public importance .
competition is not only the basis of protection to the consumer but is the incentive to progress .
however , the interpretation of these laws by the courts , the changes in business , especially in the economic effects upon those enterprises closely related to the use of the natural resources of the country , make such an inquiry advisable .
the producers of these materials assert that certain unfortunate results of wasteful and destructive use of these natural resources together with a destructive competition which impoverishes both operator and worker can not be remedied because of the prohibitive interpretation of the antitrust laws .
the well - known condition of the bituminous coal industry is an illustration .
the people have a vital interest in the conservation of their natural resources ; in the prevention of wasteful practices ; in conditions of destructive competition which may impoverish the producer and the wage earner ; and they have an equal interest in maintaining adequate competition .
i therefore suggest that an inquiry be directed especially to the effect of the workings of the antitrust laws in these particular fields to determine if these evils can be remedied without sacrifice of the fundamental purpose of these laws .
it is urged by many thoughtful citizens that the peculiar economic effect of the income tax on so - called capital gains at the present rate is to enhance speculative inflation and likewise impede business recovery .
i believe this to be the case and i recommend that a study be made of the economic effects of this tax and of its relation to the general structure of our income tax law .
there is need for revision of our immigration laws upon a more limited and more selective basis , flexible to the needs of the country .
under conditions of current unemployment it is obvious that persons coming to the united states seeking work would likely become either a direct or indirect public charge .
as a temporary measure the officers issuing visas to immigrants have been , in pursuance of the law , instructed to refuse visas to applicants likely to fall into this class .
as a result the visas issued have decreased from an average of about 24,000 per month prior to restrictions to a rate of about 7,000 during the last month .
these are largely preferred persons under the law .
visas from mexico are about 250 per month compared to about 4,000 previous to restrictions .
the whole subject requires exhaustive reconsideration .
i urge the strengthening of our deportation laws so as to more fully rid ourselves of criminal aliens .
furthermore , thousands of persons have entered the country in violation of the immigration laws .
the very method of their entry indicates their objectionable character , and our law - abiding foreign - born residents suffer in consequence .
i recommend that the congress provide methods of strengthening the government to correct this abuse .
due to deferment of government building over many years , previous administrations had been compelled to enter upon types of leases for secondary facilities in large cities , some of which were objectionable as representing too high a return upon the value of the property .
to prevent the occasion for further uneconomic leasing i recommend that the congress authorize the building by the government of its own facilities .
the nation has generously expanded its care for veterans .
the consolidation of all veterans ' activities into the veterans ' administration has produced substantial administrative economies .
the consolidation also brings emphasis to the inequalities in service and allowances .
the whole subject is under study by the administrator , and i recommend it should also be examined by the committees of the congress .
i urge further consideration by the congress of the recommendations i made a year ago looking to the development through temporary federal aid of adequate state and local services for the health of children and the further stamping out of communicable disease , particularly in the rural sections .
the advance of scientific discovery , methods , and social thought imposes a new vision in these matters .
the drain upon the federal treasury is comparatively small .
the results both economic and moral are of the utmost importance .
it is my belief that after the passing of this depression , when we can examine it in retrospect , we shall need to consider a number of other questions as to what action may be taken by the government to remove possible governmental influences which make for instability and to better organize mitigation of the effect of depression .
it is as yet too soon to constructively formulate such measures .
there are many administrative subjects , such as departmental reorganization , extension of the civil service , readjustment of the postal rates , etc . ,
which at some appropriate time require the attention of the congress .
our relations with foreign countries have been maintained upon a high basis of cordiality and good will .
during the past year the london naval pact was completed , approved by the senate , and ratified by the governments concerned .
by this treaty we have abolished competition in the building of warships , have established the basis of parity of the united states with the strongest of foreign powers , and have accomplished a substantial reduction in war vessels .
during the year there has been an extended political unrest in the world .
asia continues in disturbed condition , and revolutions have taken place in brazil , argentina , peru , and bolivia .
despite the jeopardy to our citizens and their property which naturally arises in such circumstances , we have , with the cooperation of the governments concerned , been able to meet all such instances without friction .
we have resumed normal relations with the new governments of brazil , argentina , peru , and bolivia immediately upon evidence that they were able to give protection to our citizens and their property , and that they recognized their international obligations .
a commission which was supported by the congress has completed its investigation and reported upon our future policies in respect to haiti and proved of high value in securing the acceptance of these policies .
an election has been held and a new government established .
we have replaced our high commissioner by a minister and have begun the gradual withdrawal of our activities with view to complete retirement at the expiration of the present treaty in 1935 .
a number of arbitration and conciliation treaties have been completed or negotiated during the year , and will be presented for approval by the senate .
i shall , in a special message , lay before the senate the protocols covering the statutes of the world court which have been revised to accord with the sense of previous senate reservations .

to the senate and house of representatives : 
 the constitution requires that the president " shall , from time to time , give to the congress information of the state of the union , and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . "
in complying with that requirement i wish to emphasize that during the past year the nation has continued to grow in strength ; our people have advanced in comfort ; we have gained in knowledge ; the education of youth has been more widely spread ; moral and spiritual forces have been maintained ; peace has become more assured .
the problems with which we are confronted are the problems of growth and of progress .
in their solution we have to determine the facts , to develop the relative importance to be assigned to such facts , to formulate a common judgment upon them , and to realize solutions in spirit of conciliation .
we are not only at peace with all the world , but the foundations for future peace are being substantially strengthened .
to promote peace is our long - established policy .
through the kellogg - briand pact a great moral standard has been raised in the world .
by it fifty - four nations have covenanted to renounce war and to settle all disputes by pacific means .
through it a new world outlook has been inaugurated which has profoundly affected the foreign policies of nations .
since its inauguration we have initiated new efforts not only in the organization of the machinery of peace but also to eliminate dangerous forces which produce controversies amongst nations .
in january , 1926 , the senate gave its consent to adherence to the court of international justice with certain reservations .
in september of this year the statute establishing the court has , by the action of the nations signatory , been amended to meet the senate 's reservations and to go even beyond those reservations to make clear that the court is a true international court of justice .
i believe it will be clear to everyone that no controversy or question in which this country has or claims an interest can be passed on by the court without our consent at the time the question arises .
the doubt about advisory opinions has been completely safeguarded .
our adherence to the international court is , as now constituted , not the slightest step toward entry into the league of nations .
as i have before indicated , i shall direct that our signature be affixed to the protocol of adherence and shall submit it for the approval of the senate with a special message at some time when it is convenient to deal with it .
in the hope of reducing friction in the world , and with the desire that we may reduce the great economic burdens of naval armament , we have joined in conference with great britain , france , italy , and japan to be held in london in january to consider the further limitation and reduction of naval arms .
we hold high hopes that success may attend this effort .
at the beginning of the present administration the neighboring state of mexico was best with domestic insurrection .
we maintained the embargo upon the shipment of arms to mexico but permitted the duly constituted government to procure supplies from our surplus war stocks .
fortunately , the mexican government by its own strength successfully withstood the insurrection with but slight damage .
opportunity of further peaceful development is given to that country .
at the request of the mexican government , we have since lifted the embargo on shipment of arms altogether .
the two governments have taken further steps to promote friendly relationships and so solve our differences .
conventions prolonging for a period of two years the life of the general and special claims commissions have been concluded .
in south america we are proud to have had part in the settlement of the long - standing dispute between chile and peru in the disposal of the question of tacna - arica .
the work of the commission of inquiry and conciliation between bolivia and paraguay , in which a representative of this government participated , has successfully terminated an incident which seemed to threaten war .
the proposed plan for final settlement as suggested by the neutral governments is still under consideration .
this government has continued its efforts to act as a mediator in boundary difficulties between guatemala and honduras .
a further instance of profound importance in establishing good will was the inauguration of regular air mail service between the united states and caribbean , central american , and south american countries .
we still have marines on foreign soil -- in nicaragua , haiti , and china .
in the large sense we do not wish to be represented abroad in such manner .
about 1,600 marines remain in nicaragua at the urgent request of that government and the leaders of all parties pending the training of a domestic constabulary capable of insuring tranquility .
we have already reduced these forces materially and we are anxious to withdraw them further as the situation warrants .
in haiti we have about 700 marines , but it is a much more difficult problem , the solution of which is still obscure .
if congress approves , i shall dispatch a commission to haiti to review and study the matter in an endeavor to arrive at some more definite policy than at present .
our forces in china constitute 2,605 men , which we hope also further to reduce to the normal legation guard .
it is my desire to establish more firmly our understanding and relationships with the latin american countries by strengthening the diplomatic missions to those countries .
it is my hope to secure men long experienced in our diplomatic service , who speak the languages of the peoples to whom they are accredited , as chiefs of our diplomatic missions in these states .
i shall send to the senate at an early date the nominations of several such men .
the congress has by numerous wise and foresighted acts in the past few years greatly strengthened the character of our representation abroad .
it has made liberal provision for the establishment of suitable quarters for our foreign staffs in the different countries .
in order , however , that we may further develop the most effective force in this , one of the most responsible functions of our government , i shall recommend to the congress more liberal appropriations for the work of the state department .
i know of no expenditure of public money from which a greater economic and moral return can come to us than by assuring the most effective conduct of our foreign relations .
to preserve internal order and freedom from encroachment is the first purpose of government .
our army and navy are being maintained in a most efficient state under officers of high intelligence and zeal .
the extent and expansion of their numbers and equipment as at present authorized are ample for this purpose .
we can well be deeply concerned , however , at the growing expense .
from a total expenditure for national defense purposes in 1914 of $ 267,000,000 , it naturally rose with the great war , but receded again to $ 612,000,000 in 1924 , when again it began to rise until during the current fiscal year the expenditures will reach to over $ 730,000,000 , excluding all civilian services of those departments .
programs now authorized will carry it to still larger figures in future years .
while the remuneration paid to our soldiers and sailors is justly at a higher rate than that of any other country in the world , and while the cost of subsistence is higher , yet the total of our expenditures is in excess of those of the most highly militarized nations of the world .
upon the conference shortly to be held in london will depend such moderation as we can make in naval expenditure .
if we shall be compelled to undertake the naval construction implied in the washington arms treaty as well as other construction which would appear to be necessary if no international agreement can be completed , we shall be committed during the next six years to a construction expenditure of upward of $ 1,200,000,000 besides the necessary further increase in costs for annual upkeep .
after 1914 the various army contingents necessarily expanded to the end of the great war and then receded to the low point in 1924 , when expansion again began .
in 1914 the officers and men in our regular forces , both army and navy , were about 164,000 , in 1924 there were about 256,000 , and in 1929 there were about 250,000 .
our citizens ' army , however , including the national guard and other forms of reserves , increase these totals up to about 299,000 in 1914 , about 672,000 in 1924 , and about 728,000 in 1929 .
under the kellogg pact we have undertaken never to use war as an instrument of national policy .
we have , therefore , undertaken by covenant to use these equipments solely for defensive purposes .
from a defense point of view our forces should be proportioned to national need and should , therefore , to some extent be modified by the prospects of peace , which were never brighter than to - day .
it should be borne in mind that the improvement in the national guard by federal support begun in 1920 has definitely strengthened our national security by rendering them far more effective than ever heretofore .
the advance of aviation has also greatly increased our effectiveness in defense .
in addition to the very large program of air forces which we are maintaining in the army and navy , there has been an enormous growth of commercial aviation .
this has provided unanticipated reserves in manufacturing capacity and in industrial and air personnel , which again adds to our security .
i recommend that congress give earnest consideration to the possibilities of prudent action which will give relief from our continuously mounting expenditures .
the finances of the government are in sound condition .
i shall submit the detailed evidences and the usual recommendations in the special budget message .
i may , however , summarize our position .
the public debt on june 30 this year stood at $ 16,931,000,000 , compared to the maximum in august , 1919 , of $ 26,596,000,000 .
since june 30 it has been reduced by a further $ 238,000,000 .
in the budget to be submitted the total appropriations recommended for the fiscal year 1931 are $ 3,830,445,231 , as compared to $ 3,976,141,651 for the present fiscal year .
the present fiscal year , however , includes $ 150,000,000 for the federal farm board , as to which no estimate can as yet be determined for 1931 .
owing to the many necessary burdens assumed by congress in previous years which now require large outlays , it is with extreme difficulty that we shall be able to keep the expenditures for the next fiscal year within the bounds of the present year .
economies in many directions have permitted some accommodation of pressing needs , the net result being an increase , as shown above , of about one - tenth of 1 per cent above the present fiscal year .
we can not fail to recognize the obligations of the government in support of the public welfare but we must coincidentally bear in mind the burden of taxes and strive to find relief through some tax reduction .
every dollar so returned fertilizes the soil of prosperity .
the estimate submitted to me by the secretary of the treasury and the budget director indicates that the government will close the fiscal year 1930 with a surplus of about $ 225,000,000 and the fiscal year 1931 with a surplus of about $ 123,000,000 .
owing to unusual circumstances , it has been extremely difficult to estimate future revenues with accuracy .
i believe , however , that the congress will be fully justified in giving the benefits of the prospective surpluses to the taxpayers , particularly as ample provision for debt reduction has been made in both years through the form of debt retirement from ordinary revenues .
in view of the uncertainty in respect of future revenues and the comparatively small size of the indicated surplus in 1931 , relief should take the form of a provisional revision of tax rates .
i recommend that the normal income tax rates applicable to the incomes of individuals for the calendar year 1929 be reduced from 5 , 3 , and 1 & frac12 ; per cent , to 4 , 2 , and & frac12 ; per cent , and that the tax on the income of corporations for the calendar year 1929 be reduced from 12 to 11 per cent .
it is estimated that this will result in a reduction of $ 160,000,000 in income taxes to be collected during the calendar year 1930 .
the loss in revenue will be divided approximately equally between the fiscal years 1930 and 1931 .
such a program will give a measure of tax relief to the maximum number of taxpayers , with relatively larger benefits to taxpayers with small or moderate incomes .
the past year has brought us near to completion of settlements of the indebtedness of foreign governments to the united states .
the act of congress approved february 4 , 1929 , authorized the settlement with the government of austria along lines similar to the terms of settlement offered by that government to its other relief creditors .
no agreement has yet been concluded with that government , but the form of agreement has been settled and its execution only awaits the government of austria securing the assent by all the other relief creditors of the terms offered .
the act of congress approved february 14 , 1929 , authorized the settlement with the government of greece , and an agreement was concluded on may 10 , 1929 .
the government of france ratified the agreement with us on july 27 , 1929 .
this agreement will shortly be before the congress and i recommend its approval .
the only indebtedness of foreign governments to the united states now unsettled is that of russia and armenia .
during the past year a committee of distinguished experts under american leadership submitted a plan looking to a revision of claims against germany by the various governments .
the united states denied itself any participation in the war settlement of general reparations and our claims are comparatively small in amount .
they arise from costs of the army of occupation and claims of our private citizens for losses under awards from the mixed claims commission established under agreement with the german government .
in finding a basis for settlement it was necessary for the committee of experts to request all the governments concerned to make some contribution to the adjustment and we have felt that we should share a proportion of the concessions made .
the state and treasury departments will be in a position shortly to submit for your consideration a draft of an agreement to be executed between the united states and germany providing for the payments of these revised amounts .
a more extensive statement will be submitted at that time .
the total amount of indebtedness of the various countries to the united states now funded is $ 11,579,465,885 .
this sum was in effect provided by the issue of united states government bonds to our own people .
the payments of the various governments to us on account of principal and interest for 1930 are estimated at a total of about $ 239,000,000 , for 1931 at about $ 236,000,000 , for 1932 at about $ 246,000,000 .
the measure of american compromise in these settlements may be appreciated from the fact that our taxpayers are called upon to find annually about $ 475,000,000 in interest and in addition to redeem the principal of sums borrowed by the united states government for these purposes .
the wise determination that this property seized in war should be returned to its owners has proceeded with considerable rapidity .
of the original seized cash and property ( valued at a total of about $ 625,000,000 ) , all but $ 111,566,700 has been returned .
most of the remainder should be disposed of during the next year .
the country has enjoyed a large degree of prosperity and sound progress during the past year with a steady improvement in methods of production and distribution and consequent advancement in standards of living .
progress has , of course , been unequal among industries , and some , such as coal , lumber , leather , and textiles , still lag behind .
the long upward trend of fundamental progress , however , gave rise to over - optimism as to profits , which translated itself into a wave of uncontrolled speculation in securities , resulting in the diversion of capital from business to the stock market and the inevitable crash .
the natural consequences have been a reduction in the consumption of luxuries and semi - necessities by those who have met with losses , and a number of persons thrown temporarily out of employment .
prices of agricultural products dealt in upon the great markets have been affected in sympathy with the stock crash .
fortunately , the federal reserve system had taken measures to strengthen the position against the day when speculation would break , which together with the strong position of the banks has carried the whole credit system through the crisis without impairment .
the capital which has been hitherto absorbed in stock - market loans for speculative purposes is now returning to the normal channels of business .
there has been no inflation in the prices of commodities ; there has been no undue accumulation of goods , and foreign trade has expanded to a magnitude which exerts a steadying influence upon activity in industry and employment .
the sudden threat of unemployment and especially the recollection of the economic consequences of previous crashes under a much less secured financial system created unwarranted pessimism and fear .
it was recalled that past storms of similar character had resulted in retrenchment of construction , reduction of wages , and laying off of workers .
the natural result was the tendency of business agencies throughout the country to pause in their plans and proposals for continuation and extension of their businesses , and this hesitation unchecked could in itself intensify into a depression with widespread unemployment and suffering .
i have , therefore , instituted systematic , voluntary measures of cooperation with the business institutions and with state and municipal authorities to make certain that fundamental businesses of the country shall continue as usual , that wages and therefore consuming power shall not be reduced , and that a special effort shall be made to expand construction work in order to assist in equalizing other deficits in employment .
due to the enlarged sense of cooperation and responsibility which has grown in the business world during the past few years the response has been remarkable and satisfactory .
we have canvassed the federal government and instituted measures of prudent expansion in such work that should be helpful , and upon which the different departments will make some early recommendations to congress .
i am convinced that through these measures we have reestablished confidence .
wages should remain stable .
a very large degree of industrial unemployment and suffering which would otherwise have occurred has been prevented .
agricultural prices have reflected the returning confidence .
the measures taken must be vigorously pursued until normal conditions are restored .
the agricultural situation is improving .
the gross farm income as estimated by the department of agriculture for the crop season 1926 - 27 was $ 12,100,000,000 ; for 1927 - 28 it was $ 12,300,000,000 ; for 1928 - 29 it was $ 12,500,000,000 ; and estimated on the basis of prices since the last harvest the value of the 1929 - 30 crop would be over $ 12,650,000,000 .
the slight decline in general commodity prices during the past few years naturally assists the farmers ' buying power .
the number of farmer bankruptcies is very materially decreased below previous years .
the decline in land values now seems to be arrested and rate of movement from the farm to the city has been reduced .
not all sections of agriculture , of course , have fared equally , and some areas have suffered from drought .
responsible farm leaders have assured me that a large measure of confidence is returning to agriculture and that a feeling of optimism pervades that industry .
the most extensive action for strengthening the agricultural industry ever taken by any government was inaugurated through the farm marketing act of june 15 last .
under its provisions the federal farm board has been established , comprised of men long and widely experienced in agriculture and sponsored by the farm organizations of the country .
during its short period of existence the board has taken definite steps toward a more efficient organization of agriculture , toward the elimination of waste in marketing , and toward the upbuilding of farmers ' marketing organizations on sounder and more efficient lines .
substantial headway has been made in the organization of four of the basic commodities -- grain , cotton , livestock , and wool .
support by the board to cooperative marketing organizations and other board activities undoubtedly have served to steady the farmers ' market during the recent crisis and have operated also as a great stimulus to the cooperative organization of agriculture .
the problems of the industry are most complex , and the need for sound organization is imperative .
yet the board is moving rapidly along the lines laid out for it in the act , facilitating the creation by farmers of farmer - owned and farmer - controlled organizations and federating them into central institutions , with a view to increasing the bargaining power of agriculture , preventing and controlling surpluses , and mobilizing the economic power of agriculture .
the special session of congress was called to expedite the fulfillment of party pledges of agricultural relief and the tariff .
the pledge of farm relief has been carried out .
at that time i stated the principles upon which i believed action should be taken in respect to the tariff : 
 " an effective tariff upon agricultural products , that will compensate the farmer 's higher costs and higher standards of living , has a dual purpose .
such a tariff not only protects the farmer in our domestic market but it also stimulates him to diversify his crops and to grow products that he could not otherwise produce , and thus lessens his dependence upon exports to foreign markets .
the great expansion of production abroad under the conditions i have mentioned renders foreign competition in our export markets increasingly serious .
it seems but natural , therefore , that the american farmer , having been greatly handicapped in his foreign market by such competition from the younger expanding countries , should ask that foreign access to our domestic market should be regulated by taking into account the differences in our costs of production .
" in considering the tariff for other industries than agriculture , we find that there have been economic shifts necessitating a readjustment of some of the tariff schedules .
seven years of experience under the tariff bill enacted in 1922 have demonstrated the wisdom of congress in the enactment of that measure .
on the whole it has worked well .
in the main our wages have been maintained at high levels ; our exports and imports have steadily increased ; with some exceptions our manufacturing industries have been prosperous .
nevertheless , economic changes have taken place during that time which have placed certain domestic products at a disadvantage and new industries have come into being , all of which create the necessity for some limited changes in the schedules and in the administrative clauses of the laws as written in 1922 .
" it would seem to me that the test of necessity for revision is , in the main , whether there has been a substantial slackening of activity in an industry during the past few years , and a consequent decrease of employment due to insurmountable competition in the products of that industry .
it is not as if we were setting up a new basis of protective duties .
we did that seven years ago .
what we need to remedy now is whatever substantial loss of employment may have resulted from shifts since that time .
" in determining changes in our tariff we must not fail to take into account the broad interests of the country as a whole , and such interests include our trade relations with other countries . "
no condition has arisen in my view to change these principles stated at the opening of the special session .
i am firmly of the opinion that their application to the pending revision will give the country the kind of a tariff law it both needs and wants .
it would be most helpful if action should be taken at an early moment , more especially at a time when business and agriculture are both cooperating to minimize future uncertainties .
it is just that they should know what the rates are to be .
even a limited revision requires the consideration and readjustment of many items .
the exhaustive inquiries and valuable debate from men representative of all parts of the country which is needed to determine the detailed rates must necessarily be accomplished in the congress .
however perfectly this rate structure may be framed at any given time , the shifting of economic forces which inevitably occurs will render changes in some items desirable between the necessarily long intervals of congressional revision .
injustices are bound to develop , such as were experienced by the dairymen , the flaxseed producers , the glass industry , and others , under the 1922 rates .
for this reason , i have been most anxious that the broad principle of the flexible tariff as provided in the existing law should be preserved and its delays in action avoided by more expeditious methods of determining the costs of production at home and abroad , with executive authority to promulgate such changes upon recommendation of the tariff commission after exhaustive investigation .
changes by the congress in the isolated items such as those to which i have referred would have been most unlikely both because of the concentrations of oppositions in the country , who could see no advantage to their own industry or state , and because of the difficulty of limiting consideration by the congress to such isolated cases .
there is no fundamental conflict between the interests of the farmer and the worker .
lowering of the standards of living of either tends to destroy the other .
the prosperity of one rests upon the well - being of the other .
nor is there any real conflict between the east and the west or the north and the south in the united states .
the complete interlocking of economic dependence , the common striving for social and spiritual progress , our common heritage as americans , and the infinite web of national sentiment , have created a solidarity in a great people unparalleled in all human history .
these invisible bonds should not and can not be shattered by differences of opinion growing out of discussion of a tariff .
under the provisions of various acts of congress $ 300,000,000 has been authorized for public buildings and the land upon which to construct them , being $ 75,000,000 for the district of columbia and $ 225,000,000 for the country at large .
excluding $ 25,000,000 which is for the acquisition of land in the so - called " triangle " in this city , this public building legislation provides for a five - year program for the district of columbia and between an eight and nine year program for the country at large .
of this sum approximately $ 27,400,000 was expended up to june 30 last , of which $ 11,400,000 has been expended in the district and $ 16,000,000 outside .
even this generous provision for both the district of columbia and the country is insufficient for most pressing governmental needs .
expensive rents and inadequate facilities are extravagance and not economy .
in the district even after the completion of these projects we shall have fully 20,000 clerks housed in rented and temporary war buildings which can last but a little longer .
i therefore recommend that consideration should be given to the extension of authorizations both for the country at large and for the district of columbia again distributed over a term of years .
a survey of the need in both categories has been made by the secretary of the treasury and the postmaster general .
it would be helpful in the present economic situation if such steps were taken as would enable early construction work .
an expedition and enlargement of the program in the district would bring about direct economies in construction by enabling the erection of buildings in regular sequence .
by maintaining a stable labor force in the city , contracts can be made on more advantageous terms .
the earlier completion of this program which is an acknowledged need would add dignity to the celebration in 1932 of the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of president washington .
in consideration of these projects which contribute so much to dignify the national capital i should like to renew the suggestion that the fine arts commission should be required to pass upon private buildings which are proposed for sites facing upon public buildings and parks .
without such control much of the effort of the congress in beautification of the capital will be minimized .
the development of inland waterways has received new impulse from the completion during this year of the canalization of the ohio to a uniform 9-foot depth .
the development of the other segments of the mississippi system should be expedited and with this in view i am recommending an increase in appropriations for rivers and harbors from $ 50,000,000 to $ 55,000,000 per annum which , together with about $ 4,000,000 per annum released by completion of the ohio , should make available after providing for other river and harbor works a sum of from $ 25,000,000 to $ 30,000,000 per annum for the mississippi system and thus bring it to early completion .
conflict of opinion which has arisen over the proposed floodway from the arkansas river to the gulf of mexico via the atchafalaya river has led me to withhold construction upon this portion of the mississippi flood control plan until it could be again reviewed by the engineers for any further recommendation to congress .
the other portions of the project are being vigorously prosecuted and i have recommended an increase in appropriations for this from $ 30,000,000 of the present year to $ 35,000,000 during the next fiscal year .
expansion of our intracoastal waterways to effective barge depths is well warranted .
we are awaiting the action of canada upon the st. lawrence waterway project .
there are over 3,000,000 miles of legally established highways in the united states , of which about 10 per cent are included in the state highway systems , the remainder being county and other local roads .
about 626,000 miles have been improved with some type of surfacing , comprising some 63 per cent of the state highway systems and 16 per cent of the local roads .
of the improved roads about 102,000 miles are hard surfaced , comprising about 22 per cent of the state highway systems and about 8 per cent of the local roads .
while proper planning should materially reduce the listed mileage of public roads , particularly in the agricultural districts , and turn these roads back to useful purposes , it is evident that road construction must be a long - continued program .
progress in improvement is about 50,000 miles of all types per annum , of which some 12,000 miles are of the more durable types .
the total expenditures of federal , state , and local governments last year for construction and maintenance assumed the huge total of $ 1,660,000,000 .
federal aid in the construction of the highway systems in conjunction with the states has proved to be beneficial and stimulating .
we must ultimately give consideration to the increase of our contribution to these systems , particularly with a view to stimulating the improvement of farm - to - market roads .
our post office deficit has now increased to over $ 80,000,000 a year , of which perhaps $ 14,000,000 is due to losses on ocean mail and air mail contracts .
the department is making an exhaustive study of the sources of the deficit with view to later recommendation to congress in respect to it .
the post office quarters are provided in part by the federal construction , in part by various forms of rent and lease arrangements .
the practice has grown up in recent years of contracting long term leases under which both rent and amortization principal cost of buildings is included .
i am advised that fully 40 per cent could be saved from many such rent and lease agreements even after allowing interest on the capital required at the normal government rate .
there are also many objectionable features to some of these practices .
the provision of adequate quarters for the post office should be put on a sound basis .
a revision of air mail rates upon a more systematic and permanent footing is necessary .
the subject is under study , and if legislation should prove necessary the subject will be presented to the congress .
in the meantime i recommend that the congress should consider the desirability of authorizing further expansion of the south american services .
during the past year progress in civil aeronautics has been remarkable .
this is to a considerable degree due to the wise assistance of the federal government through the establishment and maintenance of airways by the department of commerce and the mail contracts from the post office department .
the government - improved airways now exceed 25,000 miles -- more than 14,000 miles of which will be lighted and equipped for night - flying operations by the close of the current year .
airport construction through all the states is extremely active .
there are now 1,000 commercial and municipal airports in operation with an additional 1,200 proposed for early development .
through this assistance the nation is building a sound aviation system , operated by private enterprise .
over 6,400 planes are in commercial use , and 9,400 pilots are licensed by the government .
our manufacturing capacity has risen to 7,500 planes per annum .
the aviation companies have increased regular air transportation until it now totals 90,000 miles per day -- one - fourth of which is flown by night .
mail and express services now connect our principal cities , and extensive services for passenger transportation have been inaugurated , and others of importance are imminent .
american air lines now reach into canada and mexico , to cuba , porto rico , central america , and most of the important countries of south america .
as a whole , the railroads never were in such good physical and financial condition , and the country has never been so well served by them .
the greatest volume of freight traffic ever tendered is being carried at a speed never before attained and with satisfaction to the shippers .
efficiencies and new methods have resulted in reduction in the cost of providing freight transportation , and freight rates show a continuous descending line from the level enforced by the world war .
we have , however , not yet assured for the future that adequate system of transportation through consolidations which was the objective of the congress in the transportation act .
the chief purpose of consolidation is to secure well - balanced systems with more uniform and satisfactory rate structure , a more stable financial structure , more equitable distribution of traffic , greater efficiency , and single - line instead of multiple - line hauls .
in this way the country will have the assurance of better service and ultimately at lower and more even rates than would otherwise be attained .
legislation to simplify and expedite consolidation methods and better to protect public interest should be enacted .
consideration should also be given to relief of the members of the commission from the necessity of detailed attention to comparatively inconsequential matters which , under the existing law , must receive their direct and personal consideration .
it is in the public interest that the members of the commission should not be so pressed by minor matters that they have inadequate time for investigation and consideration of the larger questions committed to them for solution .
as to many of these minor matters , the function of the commission might well be made revisory , and the primary responsibility delegated to subordinate officials after the practice long in vogue in the executive departments .
under the impulse of the merchant marine act of 1928 the transfer to private enterprise of the government - owned steamship lines is going forward with increasing success .
the shipping board now operates about 18 lines , which is less than half the number originally established , and the estimate of expenditures for the coming fiscal year is based upon reduction in losses on government lines by approximately one - half .
construction loans have been made to the amount of approximately $ 75,000,000 out of the revolving fund authorized by congress and have furnished an additional aid to american shipping and further stimulated the building of vessels in american yards .
desirous of securing the full values to the nation of the great effort to develop our merchant marine by the merchant marine act soon after the inauguration of the present administration , i appointed an interdepartmental committee , consisting of the secretary of commerce , as chairman , the secretary of the navy , the postmaster general , and the chairman of the shipping board , to make a survey of the policies being pursued under the act of 1928 in respect of mail contracts ; to inquire into its workings and to advise the postmaster general in the administration of the act .
in particular it seemed to me necessary to determine if the result of the contracts already let would assure the purpose expressed in the act , " to further develop an american merchant marine , to assure its permanence in the transportation of the foreign trade of the united states , and for other purposes , " and to develop a coordinated policy by which these purposes may be translated into actualities .
in review of the mail contracts already awarded it was found that they aggregated 25 separate awards imposing a governmental obligation of a little over $ 12,000,000 per annum .
provision had been imposed in five of the contracts for construction of new vessels with which to replace and expand services .
these requirements come to a total of 12 vessels in the 10-year period , aggregating 122,000 tons .
some other conditions in the contracts had not worked out satisfactorily .
that study has now been substantially completed and the committee has advised the desirability and the necessity of securing much larger undertakings as to service and new construction in future contracts .
the committee at this time is recommending the advertising of 14 additional routes , making substantial requirements for the construction of new vessels during the life of each contract recommended .
a total of 40 new vessels will be required under the contracts proposed , about half of which will be required to be built during the next three years .
the capital cost of this new construction will be approximately $ 250,000,000 , involving approximately 460,000 gross tons .
should bidders be found who will make these undertakings , it will be necessary to recommend to congress an increase in the authorized expenditure by the post office of about $ 5,500,000 annually .
it will be most advantageous to grant such an authority .
a conflict as to the administration of the act has arisen in the contention of persons who have purchased shipping board vessels that they are entitled to mail contracts irrespective of whether they are the lowest bidder , the post office , on the other hand , being required by law to let contracts in that manner .
it is urgent that congress should clarify this situation .
it is desirable that congress should consider the revision of some portions of the banking law .
the development of " group " and " chain " banking presents many new problems .
the question naturally arises as to whether if allowed to expand without restraint these methods would dangerously concentrate control of credit , and whether they would not in any event seriously threaten one of the fundamentals of the american credit system -- which is that credit which is based upon banking deposits should be controlled by persons within those areas which furnish these deposits and thus be subject to the restraints of local interest and public opinion in those areas .
to some degree , however , this movement of chain or group banking is a groping for stronger support to the banks and a more secure basis for these institutions .
the growth in size and stability of the metropolitan banks is in marked contrast to the trend in the country districts , with its many failures and the losses these failures have imposed upon the agricultural community .
the relinquishment of charters of national banks in great commercial centers in favor of state charters indicates that some conditions surround the national banks which render them unable to compete with state banks ; and their withdrawal results in weakening our national banking system .
it has been proposed that permission should be granted to national banks to engage in branch banking of a nature that would preserve within limited regions the local responsibility and the control of such credit institutions .
all these subjects , however , require careful investigation , and it might be found advantageous to create a joint commission embracing members of the congress and other appropriate federal officials for subsequent report .
the federal power commission is now comprised of three cabinet officers , and the duties involved in the competent conduct of the growing responsibilities of this commission far exceed the time and attention which these officials can properly afford from other important duties .
i recommended that authority be given for the appointment of full - time commissioners to replace them .
it is also desirable that the authority of the commission should be extended to certain phases of power regulation .
the nature of the electric utilities industry is such that about 90 per cent of all power generation and distribution is intrastate in character , and most of the states have developed their own regulatory systems as to certificates of convenience , rates , and profits of such utilities .
to encroach upon their authorities and responsibilities would be an encroachment upon the rights of the states .
there are cases , however , of interstate character beyond the jurisdiction of the states .
to meet these cases it would be most desirable if a method could be worked out by which initial action may be taken between the commissions of the states whose joint action should be made effective by the federal power commission with a reserve to act on its own motion in case of disagreement or nonaction by the states .
i recommend the reorganization of the radio commission into a permanent body from its present temporary status .
the requirement of the present law that the commissioners shall be appointed from specified zones should be abolished and a general provision made for their equitable selection from different parts of the country .
despite the effort of the commissioners , the present method develops a public insistence that the commissioners are specially charged with supervision of radio affairs in the zone from which each is appointed .
as a result there is danger that the system will degenerate from a national system into five regional agencies with varying practices , varying policies , competitive tendencies , and consequent failure to attain its utmost capacity for service to the people as a whole .
it is most desirable that this question should be disposed of .
under present conditions the income from these plants is less than could otherwise be secured for its use , and more especially the public is not securing the full benefits which could be obtained from them .
it is my belief that such parts of these plants as would be useful and the revenues from the remainder should be dedicated for all time to the farmers of the united states for investigation and experimentation on a commercial scale in agricultural chemistry .
by such means advancing discoveries of science can be systematically applied to agricultural need , and development of the chemical industry of the tennessee valley can be assured .
i do not favor the operation by the government of either power or manufacturing business except as an unavoidable by - product of some other major public purpose .
any form of settlement of this question will imply entering upon a contract or contracts for the lease of the plants either as a whole or in parts and the reservation of facilities , products , or income for agricultural purposes .
the extremely technical and involved nature of such contracts dealing with chemical and electrical enterprises , added to the unusual difficulties surrounding these special plants , and the rapid commercial changes now in progress in power and synthetic nitrogen manufacture , lead me to suggest that congress create a special commission , not to investigate and report as in the past , but with authority to negotiate and complete some sort of contract or contracts on behalf of the government , subject , of course , to such general requirements as congress may stipulate .
the secretary of the interior is making satisfactory progress in negotiation of the very complex contracts required for the sale of the power to be generated at this project .
these contracts must assure the return of all government outlays upon the project .
i recommend that the necessary funds be appropriated for the initiation of this work as soon as the contracts are in the hands of congress .
conservation of national resources is a fixed policy of the government .
three important questions bearing upon conservation of the public lands have become urgent .
conservation of our oil and gas resources against future need is a national necessity .
the working of the oil permit system in development of oil and gas resources on the public domain has been subject to great abuse .
i considered it necessary to suspend the issuance of such permits and to direct the review of all outstanding permits as to compliance of the holders with the law .
the purpose was not only to end such abuse but to place the government in position to review the entire subject .
we are also confronted with a major problem in conservation due to the overgrazing on public lands .
the effect of overgrazing ( which has now become general ) is not only to destroy the ranges but by impairing the ground coverage seriously to menace the water supply in many parts of the west through quick run - off , spring floods , and autumn drought .
we have a third problem of major dimensions in the reconsideration of our reclamation policy .
the inclusion of most of the available lands of the public domain in existing or planned reclamation projects largely completes the original purpose of the reclamation service .
there still remains the necessity for extensive storage of water in the arid states which renders it desirable that we should give a wider vision and purpose to this service .
to provide for careful consideration of these questions and also of better division of responsibilities in them as between the state and federal governments , including the possible transfer to the states for school purposes of the lands unreserved for forests , parks , power , minerals , etc . ,
i have appointed a commission on conservation of the public domain , with a membership representing the major public land states and at the same time the public at large .
i recommend that congress should authorize a moderate sum to defray their expenses .
the federal government provides for an extensive and valuable program of constructive social service , in education , home building , protection to women and children , employment , public health , recreation , and many other directions .
in a broad sense federal activity in these directions has been confined to research and dissemination of information and experience , and at most to temporary subsidies to the states in order to secure uniform advancement in practice and methods .
any other attitude by the federal government will undermine one of the most precious possessions of the american people ; that is , local and individual responsibility .
we should adhere to this policy .
federal officials can , however , make a further and most important contribution by leadership in stimulation of the community and voluntary agencies , and by extending federal assistance in organization of these forces and bringing about cooperation among them .
as an instance of this character , i have recently , in cooperation with the secretaries of interior and labor , laid the foundations of an exhaustive inquiry into the facts precedent to a nation - wide white house conference on child health and protection .
this cooperative movement among interested agencies will impose no expense upon the government .
similar nation - wide conferences will be called in connection with better housing and recreation at a later date .
in view of the considerable difference of opinion as to the policies which should be pursued by the federal government with respect to education , i have appointed a committee representative of the important educational associations and others to investigate and present recommendations .
in cooperation with the secretary of the interior , i have also appointed a voluntary committee of distinguished membership to assist in a nation - wide movement for abolition of illiteracy .
i have recommended additional appropriations for the federal employment service in order that it may more fully cover its cooperative work with state and local services .
i have also recommended additional appropriations for the women 's and children 's bureaus for much needed research as to facts which i feel will prove most helpful .
the advance in scientific discovery as to disease and health imposes new considerations upon us .. the nation as a whole is vitally interested in the health of all the people ; in protection from spread of contagious disease ; in the relation of physical and mental disabilities to criminality ; and in the economic and moral advancement which is fundamentally associated with sound body and mind .
the organization of preventive measures and health education in its personal application is the province of public health service .
such organization should be as universal as public education .
its support is a proper burden upon the taxpayer .
it can not be organized with success , either in its sanitary or educational phases , except under public authority .
it should be based upon local and state responsibility , but i consider that the federal government has an obligation of contribution to the establishment of such agencies .
in the practical working out of organization , exhaustive experiment and trial have demonstrated that the base should be competent organization of the municipality , county , or other local unit .
most of our municipalities and some 400 rural counties out of 3,000 now have some such unit organization .
where highly developed , a health unit comprises at least a physician , sanitary engineer , and community nurse with the addition , in some cases , of another nurse devoted to the problems of maternity and children .
such organization gives at once a fundamental control of preventive measures and assists in community instruction .
the federal government , through its interest in control of contagion , acting through the united states public health service and the state agencies , has in the past and should in the future concern itself with this development , particularly in the many rural sections which are unfortunately far behind in progress .
some parts of the funds contributed under the sheppard - towner act through the children 's bureau of the department of labor have also found their way into these channels .
i recommend to the congress that the purpose of the sheppard towner act should be continued through the children 's bureau for a limited period of years ; and that the congress should consider the desirability of confining the use of federal funds by the states to the building up of such county or other local units , and that such outlay should be positively coordinated with the funds expended through the united states public health service directed to other phases of the same county or other local unit organization .
all funds appropriated should of course be applied through the states , so that the public health program of the county or local unit will be efficiently coordinated with that of the whole state .
closely related to crime conditions is the administration of the federal prison system .
our federal penal institutions are overcrowded , and this condition is daily becoming worse .
the parole and probation systems are inadequate .
these conditions make it impossible to perform the work of personal reconstruction of prisoners so as to prepare them for return to the duties of citizenship .
in order to relieve the pressing evils i have directed the temporary transfer of the army disciplinary barracks at leavenworth to the department of justice for use as a federal prison .
not only is this temporary but it is inadequate for present needs .
we need some new federal prisons and a reorganization of our probation and parole systems ; and there should be established in the department of justice a bureau of prisons with a sufficient force to deal adequately with the growing activities of our prison institutions .
authorization for the improvements should be given speedily , with initial appropriations to allow the construction of the new institutions to be undertaken at once .
restriction of immigration has from every aspect proved a sound national policy .
our pressing problem is to formulate a method by which the limited number of immigrants whom we do welcome shall be adapted to our national setting and our national needs .
i have been opposed to the basis of the quotas now in force and i have hoped that we could find some practical method to secure what i believe should be our real national objective ; that is , fitness of the immigrant as to physique , character , training , and our need of service .
perhaps some system of priorities within the quotas could produce these results and at the same time enable some hardships in the present system to be cleared up .
i recommend that the congress should give the subject further study , in which the executive departments will gladly cooperate with the hope of discovering such method as will more fully secure our national necessities .
it has been the policy of our government almost from its inception to make provision for the men who have been disabled in defense of our country .
this policy should be maintained .
originally it took the form of land grants and pensions .
this system continued until our entry into the world war .
the congress at that time inaugurated a new plan of compensation , rehabilitation , hospitalization , medical care and treatment , and insurance , whereby benefits were awarded to those veterans and their immediate dependents whose disabilities were attributable to their war service .
the basic principle in this legislation is sound .
in a desire to eliminate all possibilities of injustice due to difficulties in establishing service connection of disabilities , these principles have been to some degree extended .
veterans whose diseases or injuries have become apparent within a brief period after the war are now receiving compensation ; insurance benefits have been liberalized .
emergency officers are now receiving additional benefits .
the doors of the government 's hospitals have been opened to all veterans , even though their diseases or injuries were not the result of their war service .
in addition adjusted service certificates have been issued to 3,433,300 veterans .
this in itself will mean an expenditure of nearly $ 3,500,000,000 before 1945 , in addition to the $ 600,000,000 which we are now appropriating annually for our veterans ' relief .
the administration of all laws concerning the veterans and their dependents has been upon the basis of dealing generously , humanely , and justly .
while some inequalities have arisen , substantial and adequate care has been given and justice administered .
further improvement in administration may require some amendment from time to time to the law , but care should be taken to see that such changes conform to the basic principles of the legislation .
i am convinced that we will gain in efficiency , economy , and more uniform administration and better definition of national policies if the pension bureau , the national home for volunteer soldiers , and the veterans ' bureau are brought together under a single agency .
the total appropriations to these agencies now exceed $ 800,000,000 per annum .
approximately four - fifths of all the employees in the executive civil service now occupy positions subject to competitive examination under the civil service law .
there are , however , still commanding opportunities for extending the system .
these opportunities lie within the province of congress and not the president .
i recommend that a further step be taken by authorization that appointments of third - class postmasters be made under the civil service law .
this subject has been under consideration for over 20 years .
it was promised by both political parties in the recent campaign .
it has been repeatedly examined by committees and commissions -- congressional , executive , and voluntary .
the conclusions of these investigations have been unanimous that reorganization is a necessity of sound administration ; of economy ; of more effective governmental policies and of relief to the citizen from unnecessary harassment in his relations with a multitude of scattered governmental agencies .
but the presentation of any specific plan at once enlivens opposition from every official whose authority may be curtailed or who fears his position is imperiled by such a result ; of bureaus and departments which wish to maintain their authority and activities ; of citizens and their organizations who are selfishly interested , or who are inspired by fear that their favorite bureau may , in a new setting , be less subject to their influence or more subject to some other influence .
it seems to me that the essential principles of reorganization are two in number .
first , all administrative activities of the same major purpose should be placed in groups under single - headed responsibility ; second , all executive and administrative functions should be separated from boards and commissions and placed under individual responsibility , while quasi - legislative and quasi - judicial and broadly advisory functions should be removed from individual authority and assigned to boards and commissions .
indeed , these are the fundamental principles upon which our government was founded , and they are the principles which have been adhered to in the whole development of our business structure , and they are the distillation of the common sense of generations .
for instance , the conservation of national resources is spread among eight agencies in five departments .
they suffer from conflict and overlap .
there is no proper development and adherence to broad national policies and no central point where the searchlight of public opinion may concentrate itself .
these functions should be grouped under the direction of some such official as an assistant secretary of conservation .
the particular department or cabinet officer under which such a group should be placed is of secondary importance to the need of concentration .
the same may be said of educational services , of merchant marine aids , of public works , of public health , of veterans ' services , and many others , the component parts of which are widely scattered in the various departments and independent agencies .
it is desirable that we first have experience with these different groups in action before we create new departments .
these may be necessary later on .
with this background of all previous experience i can see no hope for the development of a sound reorganization of the government unless congress be willing to delegate its authority over the problem ( subject to defined principles ) to the executive , who should act upon approval of a joint committee of congress or with the reservation of power of revision by congress within some limited period adequate for its consideration .
the first duty of the president under his oath of office is to secure the enforcement of the laws .
the enforcement of the laws enacted to give effect to the eighteenth amendment is far from satisfactory and this is in part due to the inadequate organization of the administrative agencies of the federal government .
with the hope of expediting such reorganization , i requested on june 6 last that congress should appoint a joint committee to collaborate with executive agencies in preparation of legislation .
it would be helpful if it could be so appointed .
the subject has been earnestly considered by the law enforcement commission and the administrative officials of the government .
our joint conclusions are that certain steps should be taken at once .
first , there should be an immediate concentration of responsibility and strengthening of enforcement agencies of the federal government by transfer to the department of justice of the federal functions of detection and to a considerable degree of prosecution , which are now lodged in the prohibition bureau in the treasury ; and at the same time the control of the distribution of industrial alcohol and legalized beverages should remain in the treasury .
second , provision should be made for relief of congestion in the federal courts by modifying and simplifying the procedure for dealing with the large volume of petty prosecutions under various federal acts .
third , there should be a codification of the laws relating to prohibition to avoid the necessity which now exists of resorting to more than 25 statutes enacted at various times over 40 years .
technical defects in these statutes that have been disclosed should be cured .
i would add to these recommendations the desirability of reorganizing the various services engaged in the prevention of smuggling into one border patrol under the coast guard .
further recommendations upon the subject as a whole will be developed after further examination by the law enforcement commission , but it is not to be expected that any criminal law will ever be fully enforced so long as criminals exist .
the district of columbia should be the model of city law enforcement in the nation .
while conditions here are much better than in many other cities , they are far from perfect , and this is due in part to the congestion of criminal cases in the supreme court of the district , resulting in long delays .
furthermore , there is need for legislation in the district supplementing the national prohibition act , more sharply defining and enlarging the duties and powers of the district commissioners and the police of the district , and opening the way for better cooperation in the enforcement of prohibition between the district officials and the prohibition officers of the federal government .
it is urgent that these conditions be remedied .
no one will look with satisfaction upon the volume of crime of all kinds and the growth of organized crime in our country .
we have pressing need so to organize our system of administering criminal justice as to establish full vigor and effectiveness .
we need to reestablish faith that the highest interests of our country are served by insistence upon the swift and even - handed administration of justice to all offenders , whether they be rich or poor .
that we shall effect improvement is vital to the preservation of our institutions .
it is the most serious issue before our people .
under the authority of congress i have appointed a national commission on law observance and enforcement , for an exhaustive study of the entire problem of the enforcement of our laws and the improvement of our judicial system , including the special problems and abuses growing out of the prohibition laws .
the commission has been invited to make the widest inquiry into the shortcomings of the administration of justice and into the causes and remedies for them .
it has organized its work under subcommittees dealing with the many contributory causes of our situation and has enlisted the aid of investigators in fields requiring special consideration .
i am confident that as a result of its studies now being carried forward it will make a notable contribution to the solution of our pressing problems .
pending further legislation , the department of justice has been striving to weed out inefficiency wherever it exists , to stimulate activity on the part of its prosecuting officers , and to use increasing care in examining into the qualifications of those appointed to serve as prosecutors .
the department is seeking systematically to strengthen the law enforcement agencies week by week and month by month , not by dramatic displays but by steady pressure ; by removal of negligent officials and by encouragement and assistance to the vigilant .
during the course of these efforts it has been revealed that in some districts causes contributing to the congestion of criminal dockets , and to delays and inefficiency in prosecutions , have been lack of sufficient forces in the offices of united states attorneys , clerks of courts , and marshals .
these conditions tend to clog the machinery of justice .
the last conference of senior circuit judges has taken note of them and indorsed the department 's proposals for improvement .
increases in appropriations are necessary and will be asked for in order to reenforce these offices .
the orderly administration of the law involves more than the mere machinery of law enforcement .
the efficient use of that machinery and a spirit in our people in support of law are alike essential .
we have need for improvement in both .
however much we may perfect the mechanism , still if the citizen who is himself dependent upon some laws for the protection of all that he has and all that he holds dear , shall insist on selecting the particular laws which he will obey , he undermines his own safety and that of his country .
his attitude may obscure , but it can not conceal , the ugly truth that the lawbreaker , whoever he may be , is the enemy of society .
we can no longer gloss over the unpleasant reality which should be made vital in the consciousness of every citizen , that he who condones or traffics with crime , who is indifferent to it and to the punishment of the criminal , or to the lax performance of official duty , is himself the most effective agency for the breakdown of society .
law can not rise above its source in good citizenship -- in what right - minded men most earnestly believe and desire .
if the law is upheld only by government officials , then all law is at an end .
our laws are made by the people themselves ; theirs is the right to work for their repeal ; but until repeal it is an equal duty to observe them and demand their enforcement .
i have been gratified at the awakening sense of this responsibility in our citizens during the past few months , and gratified that many instances have occurred which refuted the cynicism which has asserted that our system could not convict those who had defied the law and possessed the means to resist its execution .
these things reveal a moral awakening both in the people and in officials which lies at the very foundation of the rule of law .
the test of the rightfulness of our decisions must be whether we have sustained and advanced the ideals of the american people ; self - government in its foundations of local government ; justice whether to the individual or to the group ; ordered liberty ; freedom from domination ; open opportunity and equality of opportunity ; the initiative and individuality of our people ; prosperity and the lessening of poverty ; freedom of public opinion ; education ; advancement of knowledge ; the growth of religious spirit ; the tolerance of all faiths ; the foundations of the home and the advancement of peace .

the vote in the senate today at best adds further delay to farm relief and may gravely jeopardize the enactment of legislation .
in rejecting the report of the senate and house conferees , which report was agreed to by members of both parties , the senate has in effect rejected a bill which provides for the creation of the most important agency ever set up in the government to assist an industry -- the proposed federal farm board , endowed with extraordinary authority to reorganize the marketing system in the interest of the farmer ; to stabilize his industry and to carry out these arrangements in conjunction with farm cooperatives , with a capital of $ 500 million as an earnest of the seriousness of the work .
it is a proposal for steady upbuilding of agriculture onto firm foundations of equality with other industry and would remove the agricultural problem from politics and place it in the realm of business .
the conferees bill carried out the plan advanced in the campaign in every particular .
every other plan of agricultural relief was rejected in that campaign and this plan was one of the most important issues in the principal agricultural states and was given as a mandate by an impressive majority in these states .
subsidies were condemned in the course of the campaign and the so - called debenture plan -- that is the giving of subsidies on exports -- was not raised by either party , nor by its proponents .
no serious attempt has been made to meet the many practical objections i and leaders in congress have advanced against this proposal .
it [ p.184 ] was not accepted by the house of representatives and has been overwhelmingly condemned by the press and is opposed by many leading farm organizations .
for no matter what the theory of the export subsidy may be , in the practical world we live in , it will not bring equality but will bring further disparity to agriculture .
it will bring immediate profits to some speculators and disaster to the farmer .
i earnestly hope that the congress will enact the conferees report and allow us to enter upon the building of a sound agricultural system rather than to longer deprive the farmer of the relief which he sorely needs .

" the fundamental business of the country , that is the production and distribution of commodities , is on a sound and prosperous basis .
the best evidence is that although production and consumption are at high levels , the average prices of commodities as a whole have not increased and there have been no appreciable increases in the stocks of manufactured goods .
moreover , there has been a tendency of wages to increase , the output per worker in many industries again shows an increase , all of which indicates a healthy condition .
" the construction and building material industries have been to some extent affected by the high interest rates induced by stock speculation and there has been some seasonal decrease in one or two other industries but these movements are of secondary character when considered in the whole situation .
" a temporary drop in grain prices sympathetically with stock exchange prices usually happens but as the department of agriculture points out , the overriding fact in grain is that this year 's world wheat harvest is estimated to be 500 million bushels less than that of last year , which will result in a very low carryover at the end of the harvest year . "

i have n't anything of any news here to announce .
i thought perhaps you might like that i discuss the business situation with you just a little , but not from the point of view of publication at all -- simply for your own information .
i see no particular reasons for making any public statements about it , either directly or indirectly .
the question is one somewhat of analysis .
we have had a period of over - speculation that has been extremely widespread , one of those waves of speculation that are more or less uncontrollable , as evidenced by the efforts of the federal reserve board , and that ultimately results in a crash due to its own weight .
that crash was perhaps a little expedited by the foreign situation , in that one result of this whole phenomenon has been the congestion of capital in the loan market in new york in the driving up of money rates all over the world .
the foreign central banks having determined that they would bring the crisis to an end , at least so far as their own countries were concerned , [ p.367 ] advanced money rates very rapidly in practically every european country in order to attract capital that had drifted from europe into new york , back into their own industry and commerce .
incidentally , the effect of increasing discount rates in europe is much greater on their business structure than it is with us .
our business structure is not so sensitive to interest rates as theirs is .
so their sharp advancement of discount rates tended to affect this market , and probably expedited or even started this movement .
but once the movement has taken place we have a number of phenomena that rapidly develop .
the first is that the domestic banks in the interior of the united states , and corporations , withdraw their money from the call market .
there has been a very great movement out of new york into the interior of the united states , as well as some movement out of new york into foreign countries .
the incidental result of that is to create a difficult situation in new york , but also to increase the available capital in the interior .
in the interior there has been , in consequence , a tendency for interest rates to fall at once because of the unemployed capital brought back into interior points .
perhaps the situation might be clearer on account of its parallel with the last very great crisis , 1907 - 1908 .
in that crash the same drain of money immediately took place into the interior .
in that case there was no federal reserve system .
there was no way to acquaint of capital movement over the country , and the interest rates ran up to 300 percent .
the result was to bring about a monetary panic in the entire country .
here with the federal reserve system and the activity of the board , and the ability with which the situation has been handled , there has been a complete isolation of the stock market phenomenon from the rest of the business phenomena in the country .
the board , in cooperation with the banks in new york , has made ample capital available for the call market in substitution of the withdrawals .
this has resulted in a general fall of interest rates , not only in the interior , but also in new york , as witness the reduction of the discount rate .
so that instead of having a panic rise in interest rates with monetary rise following it , we have exactly the reverse phenomenon -- we have a fallen interest [ p.368 ] rate .
that is the normal thing to happen when capital is withdrawn from the call market through diminution in values .
the ultimate result of it is a complete isolation of the stock market phenomenon from the general business phenomenon .
in other words , the financial world is functioning entirely normal and rather more easily today than it was 2 weeks ago , because interest rates are less and there is more capital available .
the effect on production is purely psychological .
so far there might be said to be from such a shock some tendency on the part of people through alarm to decrease their activities , but there has been no cancellation of any orders whatsoever .
there has been some lessening of buying in some of the luxury contracts , but that is not a phenomenon itself .
the ultimate result of the normal course of things would be that with a large release of capital from the speculative market there will be more capital available for the bond and mortgage market .
that market has been practically starved for the last 4 or 5 months .
there has been practically no -- or very little at least -- of mortgage or bond money available , practically no bond issues of any consequence .
one result has been to create considerable reserves of business .
a number of states have not been able to place their bonds for construction ; a number of municipalities with bond issues have been held up because of the inability to put them out at what they considered fair rates .
there are a great number of business concerns that would proceed with their activities in expansion through mortgage and bond money which have had to delay .
all of which comprises a very substantial reserve in the country at the present time .
the normal result will be for the mortgage and bond market to spring up again and those reserves to come in with increased activities .
the sum of it is , therefore , that we have gone through a crisis in the stock market , but for the first time in history the crisis has been isolated to the stock market itself .
it has not extended into either the production activities of the country or the financial fabric of the country , and for that i think we may give the major credit to the constitution of the federal reserve system .
and that is about a summary of the whole situation as it stands at this moment .
