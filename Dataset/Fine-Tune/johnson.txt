to the senate of the united states : 
 i have received a copy of the resolution adopted by the senate on the 21st instant , as follows : 
 whereas the senate have received and considered the communication of the president stating that he had removed edwin m. stanton , secretary of war , and had designated the adjutant - general of the army to act as secretary of war ad interim : therefore , 
 resolved by the senate of the united states , that under the constitution and laws of the united states the president has no power to remove the secretary of war and designate any other officer to perform the duties of that office ad interim .
this resolution is confined to the power of the president to remove the secretary of war and to designate another officer to perform the duties of the office ad interim , and by its preamble is made expressly applicable to the removal of mr. stanton and the designation to act ad interim of the adjutant - general of the army .
without , therefore , attempting to discuss the general power of removal as to all officers , upon which subject no expression of opinion is contained in the resolution , i shall confine myself to the question as thus limited -- the power to remove the secretary of war .
it is declared in the resolution-- 
 that under the constitution and laws of the united states the president has no power to remove the secretary of war and designate any other officer to perform the duties of that office ad interim .
as to the question of power under the constitution , i do not propose at present to enter upon its discussion .
the uniform practice from the beginning of the government , as established by every president who has exercised the office , and the decisions of the supreme court of the united states have settled the question in favor of the power of the president to remove all officers excepting a class holding appointments of a judicial character .
no practice nor any decision has ever excepted a secretary of war from this general power of the president to make removals from office .
it is only necessary , then , that i should refer to the power of the executive , under the laws of the united states , to remove from office a secretary of war .
the resolution denies that under these laws this power has any existence .
in other words , it affirms that no such authority is recognized or given by the statutes of the country .
what , then , are the laws of the united states which deny the president the power to remove that officer ?
i know but two laws which bear upon this question .
the first in order of time is the act of august 7 , 1789 , creating the department of war , which , after providing for a secretary as its principal officer , proceeds as follows : 
 sec .
2 .
and be it further enacted , that there shall be in the said department an inferior officer , to be appointed by the said principal officer , to be employed therein as he shall deem proper , and to be called the chief clerk in the department of war , and who , whenever the said principal officer shall be removed from office by the president of the united states , or in any other case of vacancy , shall during such vacancy have the charge and custody of all records , books , and papers appertaining to the said department .
it is clear that this act , passed by a congress many of whose members participated in the formation of the constitution , so far from denying the power of the president to remove the secretary of war , recognizes it as existing in the executive alone , without the concurrence of the senate or of any other department of the government .
furthermore , this act does not purport to confer the power by legislative authority , nor in fact was there any other existing legislation through which it was bestowed upon the executive .
the recognition of the power by this act is therefore complete as a recognition under the constitution itself for there was no other source or authority from which it could be derived .
the other act which refers to this question is that regulating the tenure of certain civil offices , passed by congress on the 2d day of march , 1867 .
the first section of that act is in the following words : 
 that every person holding any civil office to which he has been appointed by and with the advice and consent of the senate , and every person who shall hereafter be appointed to any such office , and shall become duly qualified to act therein , is and shall be entitled to hold such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed and duly qualified , except as herein otherwise provided : provided , that the secretaries of state , of the treasury , of war , of the navy , and of the interior , the postmaster - general , and the attorney - general shall hold their offices , respectively , for and during the term of the president by whom they may have been appointed and for one month thereafter , subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of the senate .
the fourth section of the same act restricts the term of offices to the limit prescribed by the law creating them .
that part of the first section which precedes the proviso declares that every person holding a civil office to which he has been or may be appointed by and with the advice and consent of the senate shall hold such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed .
it purports to take from the executive , during the fixed time established for the tenure of the office , the independent power of removal , and to require for such removal the concurrent action of the president and the senate .
the proviso that follows proceeds to fix the term of office of the seven heads of departments , whose tenure never had been defined before , by prescribing that they " shall hold their offices , respectively , for and during the term of the president by whom they may have been appointed and for one month thereafter , subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of the senate . "
thus , as to these enumerated officers , the proviso takes from the president the power of removal except with the advice and consent of the senate .
by its terms , however , before he can be deprived of the power to displace them it must appear that he himself has appointed them .
it is only in that case that they have any tenure of office or any independent right to hold during the term of the president and for one month after the cessation of his official functions .
the proviso , therefore , gives no tenure of office to any one of these officers who has been appointed by a former president beyond one month after the accession of his successor .
in the case of mr. stanton , the only appointment under which he held the office of secretary of war was that conferred upon him by my immediate predecessor , with the advice and consent of the senate .
he has never held from me any appointment as the head of the war department .
whatever fight he had to hold the office was derived from that original appointment and my own sufferance .
the law was not intended to protect such an incumbent of the war department by taking from the president the power to remove him .
this , in my judgment , is perfectly clear , and the law itself admits of no other just construction .
we find in all that portion of the first section which precedes the proviso that as to civil officers generally the president is deprived of the power of removal , and it is plain that if there had been no proviso that power would just as clearly have been taken from him so far as it applies to the seven heads of departments .
but for reasons which were no doubt satisfactory to congress these principal officers were specially provided for , and as to them the express and only requirement is that the president who has appointed them shall not without the advice and consent of the senate remove them from office .
the consequence is that as to my cabinet , embracing the seven officers designated in the first section , the act takes from me the power , without the concurrence of the senate , to remove any one of them that i have appointed , but it does not protect such of them as i did not appoint , nor give to them any tenure of office beyond my pleasure .
an examination of this act , then , shows that while in one part of the section provision is made for officers generally , in another clause there is a class of officers , designated by their official titles , who are excepted from the general terms of the law , and in reference to whom a clear distinction is made as to the general power of removal limited in the first clause of the section .
this distinction is that as to such of these enumerated officers as hold under the appointment of the president the power of removal can only be exercised by him with the consent of the senate , while as to those who have not been appointed by him there is no like denial of his power to displace them .
it would be a violation of the plain meaning of this enactment to place mr. stanton upon the same footing as those heads of departments who have been appointed by myself .
as to him , this law gives him no tenure of office .
the members of my cabinet who have been appointed by me are by this act entitled to hold for one month after the term of my office shall cease : but mr. stanton could not , against the wishes of my successor , hold a moment thereafter .
if he were permitted by that successor to hold for the first two weeks , would that successor have no power to remove him ?
but the power of my successor over him could be no greater than my own .
if my successor would have the power to remove mr. stanton after permitting him to remain a period of two weeks , because he was not appointed by him , but by his predecessor , i , who have tolerated mr. stanton for more than two years , certainly have the same right to remove him , and upon the same ground , namely , that he was not appointed by me , but by my predecessor .
under this construction of the tenure - of - office act , i have never doubted my power to remove mr. stanton .
whether the act were constitutional or not , it was always my opinion that it did not secure him from removal .
i was , however , aware that there were doubts as to the construction of the law , and from the first i deemed it desirable that at the earliest possible moment those doubts should be settled and the true construction of the act fixed by decision of the supreme court of the united states .
my order of suspension in august last was intended to place the case in such a position as would make a resort to a judicial decision both necessary and proper .
my understanding and wishes , however , under that order of suspension were frustrated , and the late order for mr. stanton 's removal was a further step toward the accomplishment of that purpose .
i repeat that my own convictions as to the true construction of the law and as to its constitutionality were well settled and were sustained by every member of my cabinet , including mr. stanton himself .
upon the question of constitutionality , each one in turn deliberately advised me that the tenure - of - office act was unconstitutional .
upon the question whether , as to those members who were appointed by my predecessor , that act took from me the power to remove them , one of those members emphatically stated in the presence of the others sitting in cabinet that they did not come within the provisions of the act , and it was no protection to them .
no one dissented from this construction , and i understood them all to acquiesce in its correctness .
in a matter of such grave consequence i was not disposed to rest upon my own opinions , though fortified by my constitutional advisers .
i have therefore sought to bring the question at as early a day as possible before the supreme court of the united states for final and authoritative decision .
in respect to so much of the resolution as relates to the designation of an officer to act as secretary of war ad interim , i have only to say that i have exercised this power under the provisions of the first section of the act of february 13 , 1795 , which , so far as they are applicable to vacancies caused by removals , i understand to be still in force .
the legislation upon the subject of ad interim appointments in the executive departments stands , as to the war office , as follows : 
 the second section of the act of the 7th of august , 1789 , makes provision for a vacancy in the very case of a removal of the head of the war department , and upon such a vacancy gives the charge and custody of the records , books , and papers to the chief clerk .
next , by the act of the 8th of may , 1792 , section 8 , it is provided that in case of a vacancy occasioned by death , absence from the seat of government , or sickness of the head of the war department the president may authorize a person to perform the duties of the office until a successor is appointed or the disability removed .
the act , it will be observed , does not provide for the case of a vacancy caused by removal .
then , by the first section of the act of february 13 , 1795 , it is provided that in case of any vacancy the president may appoint a person to perform the duties while the vacancy exists .
these acts are followed by that of the 20th of february , 1863 , by the first section of which provision is again made for a vacancy caused by death , resignation , absence from the seat of government , or sickness of the head of any executive department of the government , and upon the occurrence of such a vacancy power is given to the president-- 
 to authorize the head of any other executive department , or other officer in either of said departments whose appointment is vested in the president , at his discretion , to perform the duties of the said respective offices until a successor be appointed or until such absence or inability by sickness shall cease : provided , that no one vacancy shall be supplied in manner aforesaid for a longer term than six months .
this law , with some modifications , reenacts the act of 1792 , and provides , as did that act , for the sort of vacancies so to be filled : but , like the act of 1792 , it makes no provision for a vacancy occasioned by removal .
it has reference altogether to vacancies arising from other causes .
according to my construction of the act of 1863 , while it impliedly repeals the act of 1792 regulating the vacancies therein described , it has no bearing whatever upon so much of the act of 1795 as applies to a vacancy caused by removal .
the act of 1795 therefore furnishes the rule for a vacancy occasioned by removal -- one of the vacancies expressly referred to in the act of the 7th of august , 1789 , creating the department of war .
certainly there is no express repeal by the act of 1863 of the act of 1795 .
the repeal , if there is any , is by implication , and can only be admitted so far as there is a clear inconsistency between the two acts .
the act of 1795 is inconsistent with that of 1863 as to a vacancy occasioned by death , resignation , absence , or sickness , but not at all inconsistent as to a vacancy caused by removal .
it is assuredly proper that the president should have the same power to fill temporarily a vacancy occasioned by removal as he has to supply a place made vacant by death or the expiration of a term .
if , for instance , the incumbent of an office should be found to be wholly unfit to exercise its functions , and the public service should require his immediate expulsion , a remedy should exist and be at once applied , and time be allowed the president to select and appoint a successor , as is permitted him in case of a vacancy caused by death or the termination of an official term .
the necessity , therefore , for an ad interim appointment is just as great , and , indeed , may be greater in cases of removal than in any others .
before it be held , therefore , that the power given by the act of 1795 in cases of removal is abrogated by succeeding legislation an express repeal ought to appear .
so wholesome a power should certainly not be taken away by loose implication .
it may be , however , that in this , as in other cases of implied repeal , doubts may arise .
it is confessedly one of the most subtle and debatable questions which arise in the construction of statutes .
if upon such a question i have fallen into an erroneous construction , i submit whether it should be characterized as a violation of official duty and of law .
i have deemed it proper , in vindication of the course which i have considered it my duty to take , to place before the senate the reasons upon which i have based my action .
although i have been advised by every member of my cabinet that the entire tenure - of - office act is unconstitutional , and therefore void , and although i have expressly concurred in that opinion in the veto message which i had the honor to submit to congress when i returned the bill for reconsideration , i have refrained from making a removal of any officer contrary to the provisions of the law , and have only exercised that power in the case of mr. stanton , which , in my judgment , did not come within its provisions .
i have endeavored to proceed with the greatest circumspection , and have acted only in an extreme and exceptional case , carefully following the course which i have marked out for myself as a general rule , faithfully to execute all laws , though passed over my objections on the score of constitutionality .
in the present instance i have appealed , or sought to appeal , to that final arbiter fixed by the constitution for the determination of all such questions .
to this course i have been impelled by the solemn obligations which rest upon me to sustain inviolate the powers of the high office committed to my hands .
whatever may be the consequences merely personal to myself , i could not allow them to prevail against a public duty so clear to my own mind , and so imperative .
if what was possible had been certain , if i had been fully advised when i removed mr. stanton that in thus defending the trust committed to my hands my own removal was sure to follow , i could not have hesitated .
actuated by public considerations of the highest character , i earnestly protest against the resolution of the senate which charges me in what i have done with a violation of the constitution and laws of the united states .

to the house of representatives of the united states : 
 i return herewith the bill entitled " an act supplementary to an act entitled ' an act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel states , ' passed on the 2d day of march , 1867 , and the act supplementary thereto , passed on the 23d day of march , 1867 , " and will state as briefly as possible some of the reasons which prevent me from giving it my approval .
this is one of a series of measures passed by congress during the last four months on the subject of reconstruction .
the message returning the act of the 2d of march last states at length my objections to the passage of that measure .
they apply equally well to the bill now before me , and i am content merely to refer to them and to reiterate my conviction that they are sound and unanswerable .
there are some points peculiar to this bill , which i will proceed at once to consider .
the first section purports to declare " the true intent and meaning , " in some particulars , of the two prior acts upon this subject .
it is declared that the intent of those acts was , first , that the existing governments in the ten " rebel states " " were not legal state governments , " and , second , " that thereafter said governments , if continued , were to be continued subject in all respects to the military commanders of the respective districts and to the paramount authority of congress . "
congress may by a declaratory act fix upon a prior act a construction altogether at variance with its apparent meaning , and from the time at least , when such a construction is fixed the original act will be construed to mean exactly what it is stated to mean by the declaratory statute .
there will be , then , from the time this bill may become a law no doubt , no question , as to the relation in which the " existing governments " in those states , called in the original act " the provisional governments , " stand toward the military authority .
as those relations stood before the declaratory act , these " governments , " it is true , were made subject to absolute military authority in many important respects , but not in all , the language of the act being " subject to the military authority of the united states , as hereinafter prescribed . "
by the sixth section of the original act these governments were made " in all respects subject to the paramount authority of the united states . "
now by this declaratory act it appears that congress did not by the original act intend to limit the military authority to any particulars or subjects therein " prescribed , " but meant to make it universal .
thus over all of these ten states this military government is now declared to have unlimited authority .
it is no longer confined to the preservation of the public peace , the administration of criminal law , the registration of voters , and the superintendence of elections , but " in all respects " is asserted to be paramount to the existing civil governments .
it is impossible to conceive any state of society more intolerable than this ; and yet it is to this condition that 12,000,000 american citizens are reduced by the congress of the united states .
over every foot of the immense territory occupied by these american citizens the constitution of the united states is theoretically in full operation .
it binds all the people there and should protect them ; yet they are denied every one of its sacred guaranties .
of what avail will it be to any one of these southern people when seized by a file of soldiers to ask for the cause of arrest or for the production of the warrant ?
of what avail to ask for the privilege of bail when in military custody , which knows no such thing as bail ?
of what avail to demand a trial by jury , process for witnesses , a copy of the indictment , the privilege of counsel , or that greater privilege , the writ of habeas corpus ?
the veto of the original bill of the 2d of march was based on two distinct grounds -- the interference of congress in matters strictly appertaining to the reserved powers of the states and the establishment of military tribunals for the trial of citizens in time of peace .
the impartial reader of that message will understand that all that it contains with respect to military despotism and martial law has reference especially to the fearful power conferred on the district commanders to displace the criminal courts and assume jurisdiction to try and to punish by military boards ; that , potentially , the suspension of the habeas corpus was martial law and military despotism .
the act now before me not only declares that the intent was to confer such military , authority , but also to confer unlimited military authority over all the other courts of the state and over all the offices of the state legislative , executive , and judicial .
not content with the general grant of power , congress , in the second section of this bill , specifically gives to each military commander the power " to suspend or remove from office , or from the performance of official duties and the exercise of official powers , any officer or person holding or exercising , or professing to hold or exercise , any civil or military office or duty in such district under any power , election , appointment , or authority derived from , or granted by , or claimed under any so - called state , or the government thereof , or any municipal or other division thereof . "
a power that hitherto all the departments of the federal government , acting in concert or separately , have not dared to exercise is here attempted to be conferred on a subordinate military officer .
to him , as a military officer of the federal government , is given the power , supported by a sufficient military force , " to remove every civil officer of the state .
what next ?
the district commander , who has thus displaced the civil officer , is authorized to fill the vacancy by the detail of an officer or soldier of the army , or by the appointment of " some other person . "
this military appointee , whether an officer , a soldier , or " some other person , " is to perform " the duties of such officer or person so suspended or removed . "
in other words , an officer or soldier of the army is thus transformed into a civil officer .
he may be made a governor , a legislator , or a judge .
however unfit he may deem himself for such civil duties , he must obey the order .
the officer of the army must , if " detailed , " go upon the supreme bench of the state with the same prompt obedience as if he were detailed to go upon a court - martial .
the soldier , if detailed to act as a justice of the peace , must obey as quickly as if he were detailed for picket duty .
what is the character of such a military civil officer ?
this bill declares that he shall perform the duties of the civil office to which he is detailed .
it is clear , however , that he does not lose his position in the military service .
he is still an officer or soldier of the army ; he is still subject to the rules and regulations which govern it , and must yield due deference , respect , and obedience toward his superiors .
the clear intent of this section is that the officer or soldier detailed to fill a civil office must execute its duties according to the laws of the state .
if he is appointed a governor of a state , he is to execute the duties as provided by the laws of that state , and for the time being his military character is to be suspended in his new civil capacity .
if he is appointed a state treasurer , he must at once assume the custody and disbursement of the funds of the state , and must perform those duties precisely according to the laws of the state , for he is intrusted with no other official duty or other official power .
holding the office of treasurer and intrusted with funds , it happens that he is required by the state laws to enter into bond with security and to take an oath of office ; yet from the beginning of the bill to the end there is no provision for any bond or oath of office , or for any single qualification required under the state law , such as residence , citizenship , or anything else .
the only oath is that provided for in the ninth section , by the terms of which everyone detailed or appointed to any civil office in the state is required " to take and to subscribe the oath of office prescribed by law for officers of the united states . "
thus an officer of the army of the united states detailed to fill a civil office in one of these states gives no official bond and takes no official oath for the performance of his new duties , but as a civil officer of the state only takes the same oath which he had already taken as a military officer of the united states .
he is , at last , a military officer performing civil duties , and the authority under which he acts is federal authority only ; and the inevitable result is that the federal government , by the agency of its own sworn officers , in effect assumes the civil government of the state .
a singular contradiction is apparent here .
congress declares these local state governments to be illegal governments , and then provides that these illegal governments shall be carried on by federal officers , who are to perform the very duties imposed on its own officers by this illegal state authority .
it certainly would be a novel spectacle if congress should attempt to carry on a legal state government by the agency of its own officers .
it is yet more strange that congress attempts to sustain and carry on an illegal state government by the same federal agency .
in this connection i must call attention to the tenth and eleventh sections of the bill , which provide that none of the officers or appointees of these military commanders " shall be bound in his action by any opinion of any civil officer of the united states , " and that all the provisions of the act " shall be construed liberally , to the end that all the intents thereof may be fully and perfectly carried out . "
it seems congress supposed that this bill might require construction , and they fix , therefore , the rule to be applied .
but where is the construction to come from ?
certainly no one can be more in want of instruction than a soldier or an officer of the army detailed for a civil service , perhaps the most important in a state , with the duties of which he is altogether unfamiliar .
this bill says he shall not be bound in his action by the opinion of any civil officer of the united states .
the duties of the office are altogether civil , but when he asks for an opinion he can only ask the opinion of another military officer , who , perhaps , understands as little of his duties as he does himself ; and as to his " action , " he is answerable to the military authority , and to the military authority alone .
strictly , no opinion of any civil officer other than a judge has a binding force .
but these military appointees would not be bound even by a judicial opinion .
they might very well say , even when their action is in conflict with the supreme court of the united states , " that court is composed of civil officers of the united states , and we are not bound to conform our action to any opinion of any such authority . "
this bill and the acts to which it is supplementary are all rounded upon the assumption that these ten communities are not states and that their existing governments are not legal .
throughout the legislation upon this subject they are called " rebel states , " and in this particular bill they are denominated " so - called states , " and the vice of illegality is declared to pervade all of them .
the obligations of consistency bind a legislative body as well as the individuals who compose it .
it is now too late to say that these ten political communities are not states of this union .
declarations to the contrary made in these three acts are contradicted again and again by repeated acts of legislation enacted by congress from the year 1861 to the year 1867 .
during that period , while these states were in actual rebellion , and after that rebellion was brought to a close , they have been again and again recognized as states of the union .
representation has been apportioned to them as states .
they have been divided into judicial districts for the holding of district and circuit courts of the united states , as states of the union only can be districted .
the last act on this subject was passed july 23 , 1866 , by which every one of these ten states was arranged into districts and circuits .
they have been called upon by congress to act through their legislatures upon at least two amendments to the constitution of the united states .
as states they have ratified one amendment , which required the vote of twenty - seven states of the thirty - six then composing the union .
when the requisite twenty - seven votes were given in favor of that amendment -- seven of which votes were given by seven of these ten states -- it was proclaimed to be a part of the constitution of the united states , and slavery was declared no longer to exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction .
if these seven states were not legal states of the union , it follows as an inevitable consequence that in some of the states slavery yet exists .
it does not exist in these seven states , for they have abolished it also in their state constitutions ; but kentucky not having done so , it would still remain in that state .
but , in truth , if this assumption that these states have no legal state governments be true , then the abolition of slavery by these illegal governments binds no one , for congress now denies to these states the power to abolish slavery by denying to them the power to elect a legal state legislature or to frame a constitution for any purpose , even for such a purpose as the abolition of slavery .
as to the other constitutional amendment , having reference to suffrage , it happens that these states have not accepted it .
the consequence is that it has never been proclaimed or understood even by congress , to be a part of the constitution of the united states .
the senate of the united states has repeatedly given its sanction to the appointment of judges , district attorneys , and marshals for every one of these states ; yet , if they are not legal states , not one of these judges is authorized to hold a court .
so , too , both houses of congress have passed appropriation bills to pay all these judges , attorneys , and officers of the united states for exercising their functions in these states .
again , in the machinery of the internal - revenue laws all these states are districted , not as " territories , " but as " states . "
so much for continuous legislative recognition .
the instances cited , however , fall far short of all that might be enumerated .
executive recognition , as is well known , has been frequent and unwavering .
the same may be said as to judicial recognition through the supreme court of the united states .
that august tribunal , from first to last , in the administration of its duties in banc and upon the circuit , has never failed to recognize these ten communities as legal states of the union .
the cases depending in that court upon appeal and writ of error from these states when the rebellion began have not been dismissed upon any idea of the cessation of jurisdiction .
they were carefully continued from term to term until the rebellion was entirely subdued and peace reestablished , and then they were called for argument and consideration as if no insurrection had intervened .
new cases , occurring since the rebellion , have come from these states before that court by writ of error and appeal , and even by original suit , where only " a state " can bring such a suit .
these cases are entertained by that tribunal in the exercise of its acknowledged jurisdiction , which could not attach to them if they had come from any political body other than a state of the union .
finally , in the allotment of their circuits made by the judges at the december term , 1865 , every one of these states is put on the same footing of legality with all the other states of the union .
virginia and north carolina , being a part of the fourth circuit , are allotted to the chief justice .
south carolina , georgia , alabama , mississippi , and florida constitute the fifth circuit , and are allotted to the late mr. justice wayne .
louisiana , arkansas , and texas are allotted to the sixth judicial circuit .
as to which there is a vacancy on the bench .
the chief justice , in the exercise of his circuit duties , has recently held a circuit court in the state of north carolina .
if north carolina is not a state of this union , the chief justice had no authority to hold a court there , and every order , judgment , and decree rendered by him in that court were coram non judice and void .
another ground on which these reconstruction acts are attempted to be sustained is this : that these ten states are conquered territory ; that the constitutional relation in which they stood as states toward the federal government prior to the rebellion has given place to a new relation ; that their territory is a conquered country and their citizens a conquered people , and that in this new relation congress can govern them by military power .
a title by conquest stands on clear ground ; it is a new title acquired by war ; it applies only to territory ; for goods or movable things regularly captured in war are called " booty , " or , if taken by individual soldiers , " plunder . "
there is not a foot of the land in any one of these ten states which the united states holds by conquest , save only such land as did not belong to either of these states or to any individual owner .
i mean such lands as did belong to the pretended government called the confederate states .
these lands we may claim to hold by conquest .
as to all other land or territory , whether belonging to the states or to individuals , the federal government has now no more title or right to it than it had before the rebellion .
our own forts , arsenals , navy - yards , custom - houses , and other federal property situate in those states we now hold , not by the title of conquest , but by our old title , acquired by purchase or condemnation for public use , with compensation to former owners .
we have not conquered these places , but have simply " repossessed " them .
if we require more sites for forts , custom - houses , or other public use , we must acquire the title to them by purchase or appropriation in the regular mode .
at this moment the united states , in the acquisition of sites for national cemeteries in these states , acquires title in the same way .
the federal courts sit in court - houses owned or leased by the united states , not in the court - houses of the states .
the united states pays each of these states for the use of its jails .
finally , the united states levies its direct taxes and its internal revenue upon the property in these states , including the productions of the lands within their territorial limits , not by way of levy and contribution in the character of a conqueror , but in the regular way of taxation , under the same laws which apply to all the other states of the union .
from first to last , during the rebellion and since , the title of each of these states to the lands and public buildings owned by them has never been disturbed , and not a foot of it has ever been acquired by the united states , even under a title by confiscation , and not a foot of it has ever been taxed under federal law .
in conclusion i must respectfully ask the attention of congress to the consideration of one more question arising under this bill .
it vests in the military commander , subject only to the approval of the general of the army of the united states , an unlimited power to remove from office any civil or military officer in each of these ten states , and the further power , subject to the same approval , to detail or appoint any military officer or soldier of the united states to perform the duties of the officer so removed , and to fill all vacancies occurring in those states by death , resignation , or otherwise .
the military appointee thus required to perform the duties of a civil office according to the laws of the state , and , as such , required to take an oath , is for the time being a civil officer .
what is his character ?
is he a civil officer of the state or a civil officer of the united states ?
if he is a civil officer of the state , where is the federal power under our constitution which authorizes his appointment by any federal officer ?
if , however , he is to be considered a civil officer of the united states , as his appointment and oath would seem to indicate , where is the authority for his appointment vested by the constitution ?
the power of appointment of all officers of the united states , civil or military , where not provided for in the constitution , is vested in the president , by and with the advice and consent of the senate , with this exception , that congress " may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone , in the courts of law , or in the heads of departments . "
but this bill , if these are to be considered inferior officers within the meaning of the constitution , does not provide for their appointment by the president alone , or by the courts of law , or by the heads of departments , but vests the appointment in one subordinate executive officer , subject to the approval of another subordinate executive officer .
so that , if we put this question and fix the character of this military appointee either way this provision of the bill is equally opposed to the constitution .
take the case of a soldier or officer appointed to perform the office of judge in one of these states , and , as such , to administer the proper laws of the state .
where is the authority to be found in the constitution for vesting in a military or an executive officer strict judicial functions to be exercised under state law ?
it has been again and again decided by the supreme court of the united states that acts of congress which have attempted to vest executive powers in the judicial courts or judges of the united states are not warranted by the constitution .
if congress can not clothe a judge with merely executive duties , how can they clothe an officer or soldier of the army with judicial duties over citizens of the united states who are not in the military or naval service ?
so , too , it has been repeatedly decided that congress can not require a state officer , executive or judicial , to perform any duty enjoined upon him by a law of the united states .
how , then , can congress confer power upon an executive officer of the united states to perform such duties in a state ?
if congress could not vest in a judge of one of these states any judicial authority under the united states by direct enactment , how can it accomplish the same thing indirectly , by removing the state judge and putting an officer of the united states in his place ?
to me these considerations are conclusive of the unconstitutionality of this part of the bill now before me , and i earnestly commend their consideration to the deliberate judgment of congress .
within a period less than a year the legislation of congress has attempted to strip the executive department of the government of some of its essential powers .
the constitution and the oath provided in it devolve upon the president the power and duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed .
the constitution , in order to carry out this power , gives him the choice of the agents , and makes them subject to his control and supervision .
but in the execution of these laws the constitutional obligation upon the president remains , but the power to exercise that constitutional duty is effectually taken away .
the military commander is as to the power of appointment made to take the place of the president , and the general of the army the place of the senate ; and any attempt on the part of the president to assert his own constitutional power may , under pretense of law , be met by official insubordination .
it is to be feared that these military officers , looking to the authority given by these laws rather than to the letter of the constitution , will recognize no authority but the commander of the district and the general of the army .
if there were no other objection than this to this proposed legislation , it would be sufficient .
whilst i hold the chief executive authority of the united states , whilst the obligation rests upon me to see that all the laws are faithfully executed , i can never willingly surrender that trust or the powers given for its execution .
i can never give my assent to be made responsible for the faithful execution of laws , and at the same time surrender that trust and the powers which accompany it to any other executive officer , high or low , or to any number of executive officers .
if this executive trust , vested by the constitution in the president , is to be taken from him and vested in a subordinate officer , the responsibility will be with congress in clothing the subordinate with unconstitutional power and with the officer who assumes its exercise .
this interference with the constitutional authority of the executive department is an evil that will inevitably sap the foundations of our federal system ; but it is not the worst evil of this legislation .
it is a great public wrong to take from the president powers conferred on him alone by the constitution , but the wrong is more flagrant and more dangerous when the powers so taken from the president are conferred upon subordinate executive officers , and especially upon military officers .
over nearly one - third of the states of the union military power , regulated by no fixed law , rules supreme .
each one of the five district commanders , though not chosen by the people or responsible to them , exercises at this hour more executive power , military and civil , than the people have ever been willing to confer upon the head of the executive department , though chosen by and responsible to themselves .
the remedy must come from the people themselves .
they know what it is and how it is to be applied .
at the present time they can not , according to the forms of the constitution , repeal these laws ; they can not remove or control this military despotism .
the remedy is , nevertheless , in their hands ; it is to be found in the ballot , and is a sure one if not controlled by fraud , overawed by arbitrary power , or , from apathy on their part , too long delayed .
with abiding confidence in their patriotism , wisdom , and integrity , i am still hopeful of the future , and that in the end the rod of despotism will be broken , the armed heel of power lifted from the necks of the people , and the principles of a violated constitution preserved .

to the senate of the united states : 
 i have examined with care the bill , which originated in the senate and has been passed by the two houses of congress , to amend an act entitled " an act to establish a bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees , " and for other purposes .
having with much regret come to the conclusion that it would not be consistent with the public welfare to give my approval to the measure , i return the hill to the senate with my objections to its becoming a law .
i might call to mind in advance of these objections that there is no immediate necessity for the proposed measure .
the act to establish a bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees , which was approved in the mouth of march last , has not yet expired : it was thought stringent and extensive enough for the purpose in view in time of war .
before it ceases to have effect further experience may assist to guide us to a wise conclusion as to the policy to be adopted in time of peace .
i share with congress the strongest desire to secure to the freedmen the full enjoyment of their freedom and property and their entire independence and equality in making contracts for their labor , but the bill before me contains provisions which in my opinion are not warranted by the constitution and are not well suited to accomplish the end in view .
the bill proposes to establish by authority of congress military jurisdiction over all parts of the united states containing refugees and freedmen .
it would by its very nature apply with most force to those parts of the united states in which the freedmen most abound , and it expressly extends the existing temporary jurisdiction of the freedmen 's bureau , with greatly enlarged powers , over those states " in which the ordinary course of judicial proceedings has been interrupted by the rebellion . "
the source from which this military jurisdiction is to emanate is none other than the president of the united states , acting through the war department and the commissioner of the freedmen 's bureau .
the agents to carry out this military jurisdiction are to be selected either from the army or from civil life ; the country is to be divided into districts and subdistricts , and the number of salaried agents to be employed may be equal to the number of counties or parishes in all the united states where freedmen and refugees are to be found .
the subjects over which this military jurisdiction is to extend in every part of the united states include protection to " all employees , agents , and officers of this bureau in the exercise of the duties imposed " upon them by the bill .
in eleven states it is further to extend over all cases affecting freedmen and refugees discriminated against " by local law , custom , or prejudice . "
in those eleven states the bill subjects any white person who may be charged with depriving a freedman of " any civil rights or immunities belonging to white persons " to imprisonment or fine , or both , without , however , defining the " civil rights and immunities " which are thus to be secured to the freedmen by military law .
this military jurisdiction also extends to all questions that may arise respecting contracts .
the agent who is thus to exercise the office of a military judge may be a stranger , entirely ignorant of the laws of the place , and exposed to the errors of judgment to which all men are liable .
the exercise of power over which there is no legal supervision by so vast a number of agents as is contemplated by the bill must , by the very nature of man , be attended by acts of caprice , injustice , and passion .
the trials having their origin under this bill are to take place without the intervention of a jury and without any fixed rules of law or evidence .
the rules on which offenses are to be " heard and determined " by the numerous agents are such rules and regulations as the president , through the war department , shall prescribe .
no previous presentment is required nor any indictment charging the commission of a crime against the laws ; but the trial must proceed on charges and specifications .
the punishment will be , not what the law declares , but such as a court - martial may think proper ; and from these arbitrary tribunals there lies no appeal , no writ of error to any of the courts in which the constitution of the united states vests exclusively the judicial power of the country .
while the territory and the classes of actions and offenses that are made subject to this measure are so extensive , the bill itself , should it become a law , will have no limitation in point of time , but will form a part of the permanent legislation of the country .
i can not reconcile a system of military jurisdiction of this kind with the words of the constitution which declare that " no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger , " and that " in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed . "
the safeguards which the experience and wisdom of ages taught our fathers to establish as securities for the protection of the innocent , the punishment of the guilty , and the equal administration of justice are to be set aside , and for the sake of a more vigorous interposition in behalf of justice we are to take the risks of the many acts of injustice that would necessarily follow from an almost countless number of agents established in every parish or county in nearly a third of the states of the union , over whose decisions there is to be no supervision or control by the federal courts .
the power that would be thus placed in the hands of the president is such as in time of peace certainly ought never to be intrusted to any one man .
if it be asked whether the creation of such a tribunal within a state is warranted as a measure of war , the question immediately presents itself whether we are still engaged in war .
let us not unnecessarily disturb the commerce and credit and industry of the country by declaring to the american people and to the world that the united states are still in a condition of civil war .
at present there is no part of our country in which the authority of the united states is disputed .
offenses that may be committed by individuals should not work a forfeiture of the rights of whole communities .
the country has returned , or is returning , to a state of peace and industry , and the rebellion is in fact at an end .
the measure , therefore , seems to be as inconsistent with the actual condition of the country as it is at variance with the constitution of the united states .
if , passing from general considerations , we examine the bill in detail , it is open to weighty objections .
in time of war it was eminently proper that we should provide for those who were passing suddenly from a condition of bondage to a state of freedom .
but this bill proposes to make the freedmen 's bureau , established by the act of 1865 as one of many great and extraordinary military measures to suppress a formidable rebellion , a permanent branch of the public administration , with its powers greatly enlarged .
i have no reason to suppose , and i do not understand it to be alleged , that the act of march , 1865 , has proved deficient for the purpose for which it was passed , although at that time and for a considerable period thereafter the government of the united states remained unacknowledged in most of the states whose inhabitants had been involved in the rebellion .
the institution of slavery , for the military destruction of which the freedmen 's bureau was called into existence as an auxiliary , has been already effectually and finally abrogated throughout the whole country by an amendment of the constitution of the united states , and practically its eradication has received the assent and concurrence of most of those states in which it at any time had an existence .
i am not , therefore , able to discern in the condition of the country anything to justify an apprehension that the powers and agencies of the freedmen 's bureau , which were effective for the protection of freedmen and refugees during the actual continuance of hostilities and of african servitude , will now , in a time of peace and after the abolition of slavery , prove inadequate to the same proper ends .
if i am correct in these views , there can be no necessity for the enlargement of the powers of the bureau , for which provision is made in the bill .
the third section of the bill authorizes a general and unlimited grant of support to the destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen , their wives and children .
succeeding sections make provision for the rent or purchase of landed estates for freedmen , and for the erection for their benefit of suitable buildings for asylums and schools , the expenses to be defrayed from the treasury of the whole people .
the congress of the united states has never heretofore thought itself empowered to establish asylums beyond the limits of the district of columbia , except for the benefit of our disabled soldiers and sailors .
it has never founded schools for any class of our own people , not even for the orphans of those who have fallen in the defense of the union , but has left the care of education to the much more competent and efficient control of the states , of communities , of private associations , and of individuals .
it has never deemed itself authorized to expend the public money for the rent or purchase of homes for the thousands , not to say millions , of the white race who are honestly toiling from day to day for their subsistence .
a system for the support of indigent persons in the united states was never contemplated by the authors of the constitution ; nor can any good reason be advanced why , as a permanent establishment , it should be founded for one class or color of our people more than another .
pending the war many refugees and freedmen received support from the government , but it was never intended that they should thenceforth be fed , clothed , educated , and sheltered by the united states .
the idea on which the slaves were assisted to freedom was that on becoming free they would be a self - sustaining population .
any legislation that shall imply that they are not expected to attain a self - sustaining condition must have a tendency injurious alike to their character and their prospects .
the appointment of an agent for every country and parish will create an immense patronage , and the expense of the numerous officers and their clerks , to be appointed by the president , will be great in the beginning , with a tendency steadily to increase .
the appropriations asked by the freedmen 's bureau as now established , for the year 1866 , amount to $ 11,745,000 .
it may be safely estimated that the cost to be incurred under the pending bill will require double that amount -- more than the entire sum expended in any one year under the administration of the second adams .
if the presence of agents in every parish and county is to be considered as a war measure , opposition , or even resistance , might be provoked ; so that to give effect to their jurisdiction troops would have to be stationed within reach of every one of them , and thus a large standing force be rendered necessary .
large appropriations would therefore be required to sustain and enforce military jurisdiction in every country or parish from the potomac to the rio grande .
the condition of our fiscal affairs is encouraging , but in order to sustain the present measure of public confidence it is necessary that we practice not merely customary economy , but , as far as possible , severe retrenchment .
in addition to the objections already stated , the fifth section of the bill proposes to take away land from its former owners without any legal proceedings being first had , contrary to that provision of the constitution which declares that no person shall " be deprived of life , liberty , or property without due process of law . "
it does not appear that a part of the lands to which this section refers may not be owned by minors or persons of unsound mind , or by those who have been faithful to all their obligations as citizens of the united states .
if any portion of the land is held by such persons , it is not competent for any authority to deprive them of it .
if , on the other hand , it be found that the property is liable to confiscation , even then it can not be appropriated to public purposes until by due process of law it shall have been declared forfeited to the government .
there is still further objection to the bill , on grounds seriously affecting the class of persons to whom it is designed to bring relief .
it will tend to keep the mind of the freedman in a state of uncertain expectation and restlessness , while to those among whom he lives it will be a source of constant and vague apprehension .
undoubtedly the freedman should be protected , but he should be protected by the civil authorities , especially by the exercise of all the constitutional powers of the courts of the united states and of the states .
his condition is not so exposed as may at first be imagined .
he is in a portion of the country where his labor can not well be spared .
competition for his services from planters , from those who are constructing or repairing railroads , and from capitalists in his vicinage or from other states will enable him to command almost his own terms .
he also possesses a perfect right to change his place of abode , and if , therefore , he does not find in one community or state a mode of life suited to his desires or proper remuneration for his labor , he can move to another where that labor is more esteemed and better rewarded .
in truth , however , each state , induced by its own wants and interests , will do what is necessary and proper to retain within its borders all the labor that is needed for the development of its resources .
the laws that regulate supply and demand will maintain their force , and the wages of the laborer will be regulated thereby .
there is no danger that the exceedingly great demand for labor will not operate in favor of the laborer .
neither is sufficient consideration given to the ability of the freedmen to protect and take care of themselves .
it is no more than justice to them to believe that as they have received their freedom with moderation and forbearance , so they will distinguish themselves by their industry and thrift , and soon show the world that in a condition of freedom they are self - sustaining , capable of selecting their own employment and their own places of abode , of insisting for themselves on a proper remuneration , and of establishing and maintaining their own asylums and schools .
it is earnestly hoped that instead of wasting away they will by their own efforts establish for themselves a condition of respectability and prosperity .
it is certain that they can attain to that condition only through their own merits and exertions .
in this connection the query presents itself whether the system proposed by the bill will not , when put into complete operation , practically transfer the entire care , support , and control of 4,000,000 emancipated slaves to agents , overseers , or taskmasters , who , appointed at washington , are to be located in every county and parish throughout the united states containing freedmen and refugees .
such a system would inevitably tend to a concentration of power in the executive which would enable him , if so disposed , to control the action of this numerous class and use them for the attainment of his own political ends .
i can not but add another very grave objection to this bill .
the constitution imperatively declares , in connection with taxation , that each state shall have at least one representative , and fixes the rule for the number to which , in future times , each state shall be entitled .
it also provides that the senate of the united states shall be composed of two senators from each state , and adds with peculiar force " that no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate . "
the original act was necessarily passed in the absence of the states chiefly to be affected , because their people were then contumaciously engaged in the rebellion .
now the case is changed , and some , at least , of those states are attending congress by loyal representatives , soliciting the allowance of the constitutional right for representation .
at the time , however , of the consideration and the passing of this bill there was no senator or representative in congress from the eleven states which are to be mainly affected by its provisions .
the very fact that reports were and are made against the good disposition of the people of that portion of the country is an additional reason why they need and should have representatives of their own in congress to explain their condition , reply to accusations , and assist by their local knowledge in the perfecting of measures immediately affecting themselves .
while the liberty of deliberation would then be free and congress would have full power to decide according to its judgment , there could be no objection urged that the states most interested had not been permitted to be heard .
the principle is firmly fixed in the minds of the american people that there should be no taxation without representation .
great burdens have now to be borne by all the country , and we may best demand that they shall be borne without murmur when they are voted by a majority of the representatives of all the people .
i would not interfere with the unquestionable right of congress to judge , each house for itself , " of the elections , returns , and qualifications of its own members ; " but that authority can not be construed as including the right to shut out in time of peace any state from the representation to which it is entitled by the constitution .
at present all the people of eleven states are excluded -- those who were most faithful during the war not less than others .
the state of tennessee , for instance , whose authorities engaged in rebellion , was restored to all her constitutional relations to the union by the patriotism and energy of her injured and betrayed people .
before the war was brought to a termination they had placed themselves in relations with the general government , had established a state government of their own , and , as they were not included in the emancipation proclamation , they by their own act had amended their constitution so as to abolish slavery within the limits of their state .
i know no reason why the state of tennessee , for example , should not fully enjoy " all her constitutional relations to the united states . "
the president of the united states stands toward the country in a somewhat different attitude from that of any member of congress .
each member of congress is chosen from a single district or state ; the president is chosen by the people of all the states .
as eleven states are not at this time represented in either branch of congress , it would seem to be his duty on all proper occasions to present their just claims to congress .
there always will be differences of opinion in the community , and individuals may be guilty of transgressions of the law , but these do not constitute valid objections against the right of a state to representation .
i would in no wise interfere with the discretion of congress with regard to the qualifications of members ; but i hold it my duty to recommend to you , in the interests of peace and the interests of union , the admission of every state to its share in public legislation when .
however insubordinate , insurgent , or rebellious its people may have been , it presents itself , not only in an attitude of loyalty and harmony , but in the persons of representatives whose loyalty can not be questioned under any existing constitutional or legal test .
it is plain that an indefinite or permanent exclusion of any part of the country from representation must be attended by a spirit of disquiet and complaint .
it is unwise and dangerous to pursue a course of measures which will unite a very large section of the country against another section of the country , however much the latter may preponderate .
the course of emigration , the development of industry and business , and natural causes will raise up at the south men as devoted to the union as those of any other part of the land ; but if they are all excluded from congress , if in a permanent statute they are declared not to be in full constitutional relations to the country , they may think they have cause to become a unit in feeling and sentiment against the government .
under the political education of the american people the idea is inherent and ineradicable that the consent of the majority of the whole people is necessary to secure a willing acquiescence in legislation .
the bill under consideration refers to certain of the states as though they had not " been fully restored in all their constitutional relations to the united states . "
if they have not , let us at once act together to secure that desirable end at the earliest possible moment .
it is hardly necessary for me to inform congress that in my own judgment most of those states , so far , at least , as depends upon their own action , have already been fully restored , and are to be deemed as entitled to enjoy their constitutional rights as members of the union .
reasoning from the constitution itself and from the actual situation of the country , i feel not only entitled but bound to assume that with the federal courts restored and those of the several states in the full exercise of their functions the rights and interests of all classes of people will , with the aid of the military in cases of resistance to the laws , be essentially protected against unconstitutional infringement or violation .
should this expectation unhappily fail , which i do not anticipate , then the executive is already fully armed with the powers conferred by the act of march , 1865 , establishing the freedmen 's bureau , and hereafter , as heretofore , he can employ the land and naval forces of the country to suppress insurrection or to overcome obstructions to the laws .
in accordance with the constitution , i return the bill to the senate , in the earnest hope that a measure involving questions and interests so important to the country will not become a law , unless upon deliberate consideration by the people it shall receive the sanction of an enlightened public judgment .

to the senate and house of representatives : 
 experience has fully demonstrated the wisdom of the framers of the federal constitution .
under all circumstances the result of their labors was as near an approximation to perfection as was compatible with the fallibility of man .
such being the estimation in which the constitution is and has ever been held by our countrymen , it is not surprising that any proposition for its alteration or amendment should be received with reluctance and distrust .
while this sentiment deserves commendation and encouragement as a useful preventive of unnecessary attempt to change its provisions , it must be conceded that time has developed imperfections and omissions in the constitution , the reformation of which has been demanded by the best interests of the country .
some of these have been remedied in the manner provided in the constitution itself .
there are others which , although heretofore brought to the attention of the people , have never been so presented as to enable the popular judgment to determine whether they should be corrected by means of additional amendments .
my object in this communication is to suggest certain defects in the constitution which seem to me to require correction , and to recommend that the judgment of the people be taken on the amendments proposed .
the first of the defects to which i desire to direct attention is in that clause of the constitution which provides for the election of president and vice - president through the intervention of electors , and not by an immediate vote of the people .
the importance of so amending this clause as to secure to the people the election of president and vice - president by their direct votes was urged with great earnestness and ability by president jackson in his first annual message , and the recommendation was repeated in five of his subsequent communications to congress , extending through the eight years of his administration .
in his message of 1829 he said : 
 " to the people belongs the fight of electing their chief magistrate ; it was never designed that their choice should in any case be defeated , either by the intervention of electoral colleges or by the agency confided , under certain contingencies , to the house of representatives . "
he then proceeded to state the objections to an election of president by the house of representatives , the most important of which was that the choice of a clear majority of the people might be easily defeated .
he then closed the argument with the following communication : 
 " i would therefore recommend such an amendment of the constitution as may remove all intermediate agency in the election of the president and vice - president .
the mode may be so regulated as to preserve to each state its present relative weight in the election , and a failure in the first attempt may be provided for by confining the second to a choice between the two highest candidates .
in connection with such an amendment it would seem advisable to limit the service of the chief magistrate to a single term of either four or six years .
if , however , it should not be adopted , it is worthy of consideration whether a provision disqualifying for office the representatives in congress on whom such an election may have devolved would not be proper . "
although this recommendation was repeated with undiminished earnestness in several of his succeeding messages , yet the proposed amendment was never adopted and submitted to the people by congress .
the danger of a defeat of the people 's choice in an election by the house of representatives remains unprovided for in the constitution , and would be greatly increased if the house of representatives should assume the power arbitrarily to reject the votes of a state which might not be cast in conformity with the wishes of the majority in that body .
but if president jackson failed to secure the amendment to the constitution which he urged so persistently , his arguments contributed largely to the formation of party organizations , which have effectually avoided the contingency of an election by the house of representatives .
these organizations , first by a resort to the caucus system of nominating candidates , and afterwards to state and national conventions , have been successful in so limiting the number of candidates as to escape the danger of an election by the house of representatives .
it is clear , however , that in thus limiting the number of candidates the true object and spirit of the constitution have been evaded and defeated .
it is an essential feature in our republican system of government that every citizen possessing the constitutional qualifications has a right to become a candidate for the office of president and vice - president , and that every qualified elector has a right to cast his vote for any citizen whom he may regard as worthy of these offices .
but under the party organizations which have prevailed for years these asserted rights of the people have been as effectually cut off and destroyed as if the constitution itself had inhibited their exercise .
the danger of a defeat of the popular choice in an election by the house of representatives is no greater than in an election made nominally by the people themselves , when by the laws of party organizations and by the constitutional provisions requiring the people to vote for electors instead of for the president or vice - president it is made impracticable for any citizen to be a candidate except through the process of a party nomination , and for any voter to cast his suffrage for any other person than one thus brought forward through the manipulations of a nominating convention .
it is thus apparent that by means of party organizations that provision of the constitution which requires the election of president and vice - president to be made through the electoral colleges has been made instrumental and potential in defeating the great object of conferring the choice of these officers upon the people .
it may be conceded that party organizations are inseparable from republican government , and that when formed and managed in subordination to the constitution they may be valuable safeguards of popular liberty ; but when they are perverted to purposes of bad ambition they are liable to become the dangerous instruments of overthrowing the constitution itself .
strongly impressed with the truth of these views , i feel called upon by an imperative sense of duty to revive substantially the recommendation so often and so earnestly made by president jackson , and to urge that the amendment to the constitution herewith presented , or some similar proposition , may be submitted to the people for their ratification or rejection .
recent events have shown the necessity of an amendment to the constitution distinctly defining the persons who shall discharge the duties of president of the united states in the event of a vacancy in that office by the death , resignation , or removal of both the president and vice - president .
it is clear that this should be fixed by the constitution , and not be left to repealable enactments of doubtful constitutionality .
it occurs to me that in the event of a vacancy in the office of president by the death , resignation , disability , or removal of both the president and vice - president the duties of the office should devolve upon an officer of the executive department of the government , rather than one connected with the legislative or judicial departments .
the objections to designating either the president pro tempore of the senate or the chief justice of the supreme court , especially in the event of a vacancy produced by removal , are so obvious and so unanswerable that they need not be stated in detail .
it is enough to state that they are both interested in producing a vacancy , and , according to the provisions of the constitution , are members of the tribunal by whose decree a vacancy may be produced .
under such circumstances the impropriety of designating either of these officers to succeed the president so removed is palpable .
the framers of the constitution , when they referred to congress the settlement of the succession to the office of president in the event of a vacancy in the offices of both president and vice - president , did not , in my opinion , contemplate the designation of any other than an officer of the executive department , on whom , in such a contingency , the powers and duties of the president should devolve .
until recently the contingency has been remote , and serious attention has not been called to the manifest incongruity between the provisions of the constitution on this subject and the act of congress of 1792 .
having , however , been brought almost face to face with this important question , it seems an eminently proper time for us to make the legislation conform to the language , intent , and theory of the constitution , and thus place the executive department beyond the reach of usurpation , and remove from the legislative and judicial departments every temptation to combine for the absorption of all the powers of government .
it has occurred to me that in the event of such a vacancy the duties of president would devolve most appropriately upon some one of the heads of the several executive departments , and under this conviction i present for your consideration an amendment to the constitution on this subject , with the recommendation that it be submitted to the people for their action .
experience seems to have established the necessity of an amendment of that clause of the constitution which provides for the election of senators to congress by the legislatures of the several states .
it would be more consistent with the genius of our form of government if the senators were chosen directly by the people of the several states .
the objections to the election of senators by the legislatures are so palpable that i deem it unnecessary to do more than submit the proposition for such an amendment , with the recommendation that it be opened to the people for their judgment .
it is strongly impressed on my mind that the tenure of office by the judiciary of the united states during good behavior for life is incompatible with the spirit of republican government , and in this opinion i am fully sustained by the evidence of popular judgment upon this subject in the different states of the union .
i therefore deem it my duty to recommend an amendment to the constitution by which the terms of the judicial officers would be limited to a period of years , and i herewith present it in the hope that congress will submit it to the people for their decision .
the foregoing views have long been entertained by me .
in 1845 , in the house of representatives , and afterwards , in 1860 , in the senate of the united states , i submitted substantially the same propositions as those to which the attention of congress is herein invited .
time , observation , and experience have confirmed these convictions ; and , as a matter of public duty and a deep sense of my constitutional obligation " to recommend to the consideration of congress such measures as i deem necessary and expedient , " i submit the accompanying propositions , and urge their adoption and submission to the judgment of the people .

joint resolution proposing amendments to the constitution of the united states 
 whereas the fifth article of the constitution of the united states provides for amendments thereto in the manner following , viz : 
 " the congress , whenever two - thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary , shall propose amendments to this constitution , or , on the application of the legislatures of two - thirds of the several states , shall call a convention for proposing amendments , which in either case shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of this constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three - fourths of the several states or by conventions in three - fourths thereof , as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the congress : provided , that no amendment which may be made prior to the year 1808 shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article , and that no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate : " 
 therefore , 
 be it resolved by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled ( two - thirds of both houses concurring ) , that the following amendments to the constitution of the united states be proposed to the legislatures of the several states , which , when ratified by the legislatures of three - fourths of the states , shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the constitution : 
 " that hereafter the president and vice - president of the united states shall be chosen for the term of six years , by the people of the respective states , in the manner following : each state shall be divided by the legislature thereof in districts , equal in number to the whole number of senators and representatives to which such state may be entitled in the congress of the united states ; the said districts to be composed of contiguous territory , and to contain , as nearly as may be , an equal number of persons entitled to be represented under the constitution , and to be laid off for the first time immediately after the ratification of this amendment ; that on the first thursday in august in the year 18 - - , and on the same day every , sixth year thereafter , the citizens of each state who possess the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures shall meet within their respective districts and vote for a president and vice - president of the united states ; and the person receiving the greatest number of votes for president and the one receiving the greatest number of votes for vice - president in each district shall be holden to have received one vote , which fact shall be immediately certified by the governor of the state to each of the senators in congress from such state and to the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives .
the congress of the united states shall be in session on the second monday in october in the year 18 - - , and on the same day in every sixth year thereafter ; and the president of the senate , in the presence of the senate and house of representatives , shall open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted .

the person having the greatest number of votes for vice - president at the first election shall be vice - president , if such number be equal to a majority of the whole number of votes given ; and if no person have such majority , then a second election shall take place between the persons having the two highest numbers on the same day that the second election is held for president , and the person having the highest number of the votes for vice - president shall be vice - president .
but if there should happen to be an equality of votes between the persons so voted for at the second election , then the person having the greatest number of votes in the greatest number of states shall be vice - president .
but when a second election shall be necessary in the case of vice - president and not necessary in the case of president , then the senate shall choose a vice - president from the persons having the two highest numbers in the first election , as now prescribed in the constitution : provided , that after the ratification of this amendment to the constitution the president and vice - president shall hold their offices , respectively , for the term of six years , and that no president or vice - president shall be eligible for reelection to a second term .

fellow - citizens of the senate and house of representatives : 

 to express gratitude to god in the name of the people for the preservation of the united states is my first duty in addressing you .
our thoughts next revert to the death of the late president by an act of parricidal treason .
the grief of the nation is still fresh .
it finds some solace in the consideration that he lived to enjoy the highest proof of its confidence by entering on the renewed term of the chief magistracy to which he had been elected ; that he brought the civil war substantially to a close ; that his loss was deplored in all parts of the union , and that foreign nations have rendered justice to his memory .
his removal cast upon me a heavier weight of cares than ever devolved upon any one of his predecessors .
to fulfill my trust i need the support and confidence of all who are associated with me in the various departments of government and the support and confidence of the people .
there is but one way in which i can hope to gain their necessary aid .
it is to state with frankness the principles which guide my conduct , and their application to the present state of affairs , well aware that the efficiency of my labors will in a great measure depend on your and their undivided approbation .
the union of the united states of america was intended by its authors to last as long as the states themselves shall last . "
the union shall be perpetual " are the words of the confederation . "
to form a more perfect union , " by an ordinance of the people of the united states , is the declared purpose of the constitution .
the hand of divine providence was never more plainly visible in the affairs of men than in the framing and the adopting of that instrument .
it is beyond comparison the greatest event in american history , and , indeed , is it not of all events in modern times the most pregnant with consequences for every people of the earth ?
the members of the convention which prepared it brought to their work the experience of the confederation , of their several states , and of other republican governments , old and new ; but they needed and they obtained a wisdom superior to experience .
and when for its validity it required the approval of a people that occupied a large part of a continent and acted separately in many distinct conventions , what is more wonderful than that , after earnest contention and long discussion , all feelings and all opinions were ultimately drawn in one way to its support ?
the constitution to which life was thus imparted contains within itself ample resources for its own preservation .
it has power to enforce the laws , punish treason , and insure domestic tranquillity .
in case of the usurpation of the government of a state by one man or an oligarchy , it becomes a duty of the united states to make good the guaranty to that state of a republican form of government , and so to maintain the homogeneousness of all .
does the lapse of time reveal defects ?
a simple mode of amendment is provided in the constitution itself , so that its conditions can always be made to conform to the requirements of advancing civilization .
no room is allowed even for the thought of a possibility of its coming to an end .
and these powers of self - preservation have always been asserted in their complete integrity by every patriotic chief magistrate by jefferson and jackson not less than by washington and madison .
the parting advice of the father of his country , while yet president , to the people of the united states was that the free constitution , which was the work of their hands , might be sacredly maintained ; and the inaugural words of president jefferson held up " the preservation of the general government in its whole constitutional vigor as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad . "
the constitution is the work of " the people of the united states , " and it should be as indestructible as the people .
it is not strange that the framers of the constitution , which had no model in the past , should not have fully comprehended the excellence of their own work .
fresh from a struggle against arbitrary power , many patriots suffered from harassing fears of an absorption of the state governments by the general government , and many from a dread that the states would break away from their orbits .
but the very greatness of our country should allay the apprehension of encroachments by the general government .
the subjects that come unquestionably within its jurisdiction are so numerous that it must ever naturally refuse to be embarrassed by questions that lie beyond it .
were it otherwise the executive would sink beneath the burden , the channels of justice would be choked , legislation would be obstructed by excess , so that there is a greater temptation to exercise some of the functions of the general government through the states than to trespass on their rightful sphere .
the " absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority " was at the beginning of the century enforced by jefferson as " the vital principle of republics ; " and the events of the last four years have established , we will hope forever , that there lies no appeal to force .
the maintenance of the union brings with it " the support of the state governments in all their rights , " but it is not one of the rights of any state government to renounce its own place in the union or to nullify the laws of the union .
the largest liberty is to be maintained in the discussion of the acts of the federal government , but there is no appeal from its laws except to the various branches of that government itself , or to the people , who grant to the members of the legislative and of the executive departments no tenure but a limited one , and in that manner always retain the powers of redress .
" the sovereignty of the states " is the language of the confederacy , and not the language of the constitution .
the latter contains the emphatic words-- 

     this constitution and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof , and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the united states , shall be the supreme law of the land , and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby , anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding .
certainly the government of the united states is a limited government , and so is every state government a limited government .
with us this idea of limitation spreads through every form of administration -- general , state , and municipal -- and rests on the great distinguishing principle of the recognition of the rights of man .
the ancient republics absorbed the individual in the state -- prescribed his religion and controlled his activity .
the american system rests on the assertion of the equal right of every man to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , to freedom of conscience , to the culture and exercise of all his faculties .
as a consequence the state government is limited -- as to the general government in the interest of union , as to the individual citizen in the interest of freedom .
states , with proper limitations of power , are essential to the existence of the constitution of the united states .
at the very commencement , when we assumed a place among the powers of the earth , the declaration of independence was adopted by states ; so also were the articles of confederation : and when " the people of the united states " ordained and established the constitution it was the assent of the states , one by one , which gave it vitality .
in the event , too , of any amendment to the constitution , the proposition of congress needs the confirmation of states .
without states one great branch of the legislative government would be wanting .
and if we look beyond the letter of the constitution to the character of our country , its capacity for comprehending within its jurisdiction a vast continental empire is due to the system of states .
the best security for the perpetual existence of the states is the " supreme authority " of the constitution of the united states .
the perpetuity of the constitution brings with it the perpetuity of the states ; their mutual relation makes us what we are , and in our political system their connection is indissoluble .
the whole can not exist without the parts , nor the parts without the whole .
so long as the constitution of the united states endures , the states will endure .
the destruction of the one is the destruction of the other ; the preservation of the one is the preservation of the other .
i have thus explained my views of the mutual relations of the constitution and the states , because they unfold the principles on which i have sought to solve the momentous questions and overcome the appalling difficulties that met me at the very commencement of my administration .
it has been my steadfast object to escape from the sway of momentary passions and to derive a healing policy from the fundamental and unchanging principles of the constitution .
i found the states suffering from the effects of a civil war .
resistance to the general government appeared to have exhausted itself .
the united states had recovered possession of their forts and arsenals , and their armies were in the occupation of every state which had attempted to secede .
whether the territory within the limits of those states should be held as conquered territory , under military authority emanating from the president as the head of the army , was the first question that presented itself for decision .
now military governments , established for an indefinite period , would have offered no security for the early suppression of discontent , would have divided the people into the vanquishers and the vanquished , and would have envenomed hatred rather than have restored affection .
once established , no precise limit to their continuance was conceivable .
they would have occasioned an incalculable and exhausting expense .
peaceful emigration to and from that portion of the country is one of the best means that can be thought of for the restoration of harmony , and that emigration would have been prevented ; for what emigrant from abroad , what industrious citizen at home , would place himself willingly under military rule ?
the chief persons who would have followed in the train of the army would have been dependents on the general government or men who expected profit from the miseries of their erring fellow - citizens .
the powers of patronage and rule which would have been exercised under the president , over a vast and populous and naturally wealthy region are greater than , unless under extreme necessity , i should be willing to intrust to any one man .
they are such as , for myself , i could never , unless on occasions of great emergency , consent to exercise .
the willful use of such powers , if continued through a period of years , would have endangered the purity of the general administration and the liberties of the states which remained loyal .
besides , the policy of military rule over a conquered territory would have implied that the states whose inhabitants may have taken part in the rebellion had by the act of those inhabitants ceased to exist .
but the true theory is that all pretended acts of secession were from the beginning null and void .
the states can not commit treason nor screen the individual citizens who may have committed treason any more than they can make valid treaties or engage in lawful commerce with any foreign power .
the states attempting to secede placed themselves in a condition where their vitality was impaired , but not extinguished ; their functions suspended , but not destroyed .
but if any state neglects or refuses to perform its offices there is the more need that the general government should maintain all its authority and as soon as practicable resume the exercise of all its functions .
on this principle i have acted , and have gradually and quietly , and by almost imperceptible steps , sought to restore the rightful energy of the general government and of the states .
to that end provisional governors have been appointed for the states , conventions called , governors elected , legislatures assembled , and senators and representatives chosen to the congress of the united states .
at the same time the courts of the united states , as far as could be done , have been reopened , so that the laws of the united states may be enforced through their agency .
the blockade has been removed and the custom - houses reestablished in ports of entry , so that the revenue of the united states may be collected .
the post - office department renews its ceaseless activity , and the general government is thereby enabled to communicate promptly with its officers and agents .
the courts bring security to persons and property ; the opening of the ports invites the restoration of industry and commerce ; the post - office renews the facilities of social intercourse and of business .
and is it not happy for us all that the restoration of each one of these functions of the general government brings with it a blessing to the states over which they are extended ?
is it not a sure promise of harmony and renewed attachment to the union that after all that has happened the return of the general government is known only as a beneficence ?
i know very well that this policy is attended with some risk ; that for its success it requires at least the acquiescence of the states which it concerns ; that it implies an invitation to those states , by renewing their allegiance to the united states , to resume their functions as states of the union .
but it is a risk that must be taken .
in the choice of difficulties it is the smallest risk ; and to diminish and if possible to remove all danger , i have felt it incumbent on me to assert one other power of the general government -- the power of pardon .
as no state can throw a defense over the crime of treason , the power of pardon is exclusively vested in the executive government of the united states .
in exercising that power i have taken every precaution to connect it with the clearest recognition of the binding force of the laws of the united states and an unqualified acknowledgment of the great social change of condition in regard to slavery which has grown out of the war .
the next step which i have taken to restore the constitutional relations of the states has been an invitation to them to participate in the high office of amending the constitution .
every patriot must wish for a general amnesty at the earliest epoch consistent with public safety .
for this great end there is need of a concurrence of all opinions and the spirit of mutual conciliation .
all parties in the late terrible conflict must work together in harmony .
it is not too much to ask , in the name of the whole people , that on the one side the plan of restoration shall proceed in conformity with a willingness to cast the disorders of the past into oblivion , and that on the other the evidence of sincerity in the future maintenance of the union shall be put beyond any doubt by the ratification of the proposed amendment to the constitution , which provides for the abolition of slavery forever within the limits of our country .
so long as the adoption of this amendment is delayed , so long will doubt and jealousy and uncertainty prevail .
this is the measure which will efface the sad memory of the past ; this is the measure which will most certainly call population and capital and security to those parts of the union that need them most .
indeed , it is not too much to ask of the states which are now resuming their places in the family of the union to give this pledge of perpetual loyalty and peace .
until it is done the past , however much we may desire it , will not be forgotten , the adoption of the amendment reunites us beyond all power of disruption ; it heals the wound that is still imperfectly closed : it removes slavery , the element which has so long perplexed and divided the country ; it makes of us once more a united people , renewed and strengthened , bound more than ever to mutual affection and support .
the amendment to the constitution being adopted , it would remain for the states whose powers have been so long in abeyance to resume their places in the two branches of the national legislature , and thereby complete the work of restoration .
here it is for you , fellow - citizens of the senate , and for you , fellow - citizens of the house of representatives , to judge , each of you for yourselves , of the elections , returns , and qualifications of your own members .
the full assertion of the powers of the general government requires the holding of circuit courts of the united states within the districts where their authority has been interrupted .
in the present posture of our public affairs strong objections have been urged to holding those courts in any of the states where the rebellion has existed ; and it was ascertained by inquiry , that the circuit court of the united states would not be held within the district of virginia during the autumn or early winter , nor until congress should have " an opportunity to consider and act on the whole subject . "
to your deliberations the restoration of this branch of the civil authority of the united states is therefore necessarily referred , with the hope that early provision will be made for the resumption of all its functions .
it is manifest that treason , most flagrant in character , has been committed .
persons who are charged with its commission should have fair and impartial trials in the highest civil tribunals of the country , in order that the constitution and the laws may be fully vindicated , the truth dearly established and affirmed that treason is a crime , that traitors should be punished and the offense made infamous , and , at the same time , that the question may be judicially settled , finally and forever , that no state of its own will has the right to renounce its place in the union .
the relations of the general government toward the 4,000,000 inhabitants whom the war has called into freedom have engaged my most serious consideration .
on the propriety of attempting to make the freedmen electors by the proclamation of the executive i took for my counsel the constitution itself , the interpretations of that instrument by its authors and their contemporaries , and recent legislation by congress .
when , at the first movement toward independence , the congress of the united states instructed the several states to institute governments of their own , they left each state to decide for itself the conditions for the enjoyment of the elective franchise .
during the period of the confederacy there continued to exist a very great diversity in the qualifications of electors in the several states , and even within a state a distinction of qualifications prevailed with regard to the officers who were to be chosen .
the constitution of the united states recognizes these diversities when it enjoins that in the choice of members of the house of representatives of the united states " the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature . "
after the formation of the constitution it remained , as before , the uniform usage for each state to enlarge the body of its electors according to its own judgment , and under this system one state after another has proceeded to increase the number of its electors , until now universal suffrage , or something very near it , is the general rule .
so fixed was this reservation of power in the habits of the people and so unquestioned has been the interpretation of the constitution that during the civil war the late president never harbored the purpose -- certainly never evowed the purpose -- of disregarding it ; and in the acts of congress during that period nothing can be found which , during the continuance of hostilities much less after their close , would have sanctioned any departure by the executive from a policy which has so uniformly obtained .
moreover , a concession of the elective franchise to the freedmen by act of the president of the united states must have been extended to all colored men , wherever found , and so must have established a change of suffrage in the northern , middle , and western states , not less than in the southern and southwestern .
such an act would have created a new class of voters , and would have been an assumption of power by the president which nothing in the constitution or laws of the united states would have warranted .
on the other hand , every danger of conflict is avoided when the settlement of the question is referred to the several states .
they can , each for itself , decide on the measure , and whether it is to be adopted at once and absolutely or introduced gradually and with conditions .
in my judgment the freedmen , if they show patience and manly virtues , will sooner obtain a participation in the elective franchise through the states than through the general government , even if it had power to intervene .
when the tumult of emotions that have been raised by the suddenness of the social change shall have subsided , it may prove that they will receive the kindest usage from some of those on whom they have heretofore most closely depended .
but while i have no doubt that now , after the close of the war , it is not competent for the general government to extend the elective franchise in the several states , it is equally clear that good faith requires the security of the freedmen in their liberty and their property , their right to labor , and their right to claim the just return of their labor .
i can not too strongly urge a dispassionate treatment of this subject , which should be carefully kept aloof from all party strife .
we must equally avoid hasty assumptions of any natural impossibility for the two races to live side by side in a state of mutual benefit and good will .
the experiment involves us in no inconsistency ; let us , then , go on and make that experiment in good faith , and not be too easily disheartened .
the country is in need of labor , and the freedmen are in need of employment , culture , and protection .
while their right of voluntary migration and expatriation is not to be questioned , i would not advise their forced removal and colonization .
let us rather encourage them to honorable and useful industry , where it may be beneficial to themselves and to the country ; and , instead of hasty anticipations of the certainty of failure , let there be nothing wanting to the fair trial of the experiment .
the change in their condition is the substitution of labor by contract for the status of slavery .
the freedman can not fairly be accused of unwillingness to work so long as a doubt remains about his freedom of choice in his pursuits and the certainty of his recovering his stipulated wages .
in this the interests of the employer and the employed coincide .
the employer desires in his workmen spirit and alacrity , and these can be permanently secured in no other way .
and if the one ought to be able to enforce the contract , so ought the other .
the public interest will be best promoted if the several states will provide adequate protection and remedies for the freedmen .
until this is in some way accomplished there is no chance for the advantageous use of their labor , and the blame of ill success will not rest on them .
i know that sincere philanthropy is earnest for the immediate realization of its remotest aims ; but time is always an element in reform .
it is one of the greatest acts on record to have brought 4,000,000 people into freedom .
the career of free industry must be fairly opened to them , and then their future prosperity and condition must , after all , rest mainly on themselves .
if they fail , and so perish away , let us be careful that the failure shall not be attributable to any denial of justice .
in all that relates to the destiny of the freedmen we need not be too anxious to read the future ; many incidents which , from a speculative point of view , might raise alarm will quietly settle themselves .
now that slavery is at an end , or near its end , the greatness of its evil in the point of view of public economy becomes more and more apparent .
slavery was essentially a monopoly of labor , and as such locked the states where it prevailed against the incoming of free industry .
where labor was the property of the capitalist , the white man was excluded from employment , or had but the second best chance of finding it ; and the foreign emigrant turned away from the region where his condition would be so precarious .
with the destruction of the monopoly free labor will hasten from all pans of the civilized world to assist in developing various and immeasurable resources which have hitherto lain dormant .
the eight or nine states nearest the gulf of mexico have a soil of exuberant fertility , a climate friendly to long life , and can sustain a denser population than is found as yet in any part of our country .
and the future influx of population to them will be mainly from the north or from the most cultivated nations in europe .
from the sufferings that have attended them during our late struggle let us look away to the future , which is sure to be laden for them with greater prosperity than has ever before been known .
the removal of the monopoly of slave labor is a pledge that those regions will be peopled by a numerous and enterprising population , which will vie with any in the union in compactness , inventive genius , wealth , and industry .
our government springs from and was made for the people -- not the people for the government .
to them it owes allegiance ; from them it must derive its courage , strength , and wisdom .
but while the government is thus bound to defer to the people , from whom it derives its existence , it should , from the very consideration of its origin , be strong in its power of resistance to the establishment of inequalities .
monopolies , perpetuities , and class legislation are contrary to the genius of free government , and ought not to be allowed .
here there is no room for favored classes or monopolies ; the principle of our government is that of equal laws and freedom of industry .
wherever monopoly attains a foothold , it is sure to be a source of danger , discord , and trouble .
we shall but fulfill our duties as legislators by according " equal and exact justice to all men , " special privileges to none .
the government is subordinate to the people ; but , as the agent and representative of the people , it must be held superior to monopolies , which in themselves ought never to be granted , and which , where they exist , must be subordinate and yield to the government .
the constitution confers on congress the right to regulate commerce among the several states .
it is of the first necessity , for the maintenance of the union , that that commerce should be free and unobstructed .
no state can be justified in any device to tax the transit of travel and commerce between states .
the position of many states is such that if they were allowed to take advantage of it for purposes of local revenue the commerce between states might be injuriously burdened , or even virtually prohibited .
it is best , while the country is still young and while the tendency to dangerous monopolies of this kind is still feeble , to use the power of congress so as to prevent any selfish impediment to the free circulation of men and merchandise .
a tax on travel and merchandise in their transit constitutes one of the worst forms of monopoly , and the evil is increased if coupled with a denial of the choice of route .
when the vast extent of our country is considered , it is plain that every obstacle to the free circulation of commerce between the states ought to be sternly guarded against by appropriate legislation within the limits of the constitution .
the report of the secretary of the interior explains the condition of the public lands , the transactions of the patent office and the pension bureau , the management of our indian affairs , the progress made in the construction of the pacific railroad , and furnishes information in reference to matters of local interest in the district of columbia .
it also presents evidence of the successful operation of the homestead act , under the provisions of which 1,160,533 acres of the public lands were entered during the last fiscal year -- more than one - fourth of the whole number of acres sold or otherwise disposed of during that period .
it is estimated that the receipts derived from this source are sufficient to cover the expenses incident to the survey and disposal of the lands entered under this act , and that payments in cash to the extent of from 40 to 50 per cent will be made by settlers who may thus at any time acquire title before the expiration of the period at which it would otherwise vest .
the homestead policy was established only after long and earnest resistance ; experience proves its wisdom .
the lands in the hands of industrious settlers , whose labor creates wealth and contributes to the public resources , are worth more to the united states than if they had been reserved as a solitude for future purchasers .
the lamentable events of the last four years and the sacrifices made by the gallant men of our army and navy have swelled the records of the pension bureau to an unprecedented extent .
on the 30th day of june last the total number of pensioners was 85,986 , requiring for their annual pay , exclusive of expenses , the sum of $ 8,023,445 .
the number of applications that have been allowed since that date will require a large increase of this amount for the next fiscal year .
the means for the payment of the stipends due under existing laws to our disabled soldiers and sailors and to the families of such as have perished in the service of the country will no doubt be cheerfully and promptly granted .
a grateful people will not hesitate to sanction any measures having for their object the relief of soldiers mutilated and families made fatherless in the efforts to preserve our national existence .
the report of the postmaster - general presents an encouraging exhibit of the operations of the post - office department during the year .
the revenues of the past year , from the loyal states alone , exceeded the maximum annual receipts from all the states previous to the rebellion in the sum of $ 6,038,091 ; and the annual average increase of revenue during the last four years , compared with the revenues of the four years immediately preceding the rebellion , was $ 3,533,845 .
the revenues of the last fiscal year amounted to $ 14,556,158 and the expenditures to $ 13,694,728 , leaving a surplus of receipts over expenditures of $ 861,430 .
progress has been made in restoring the postal service in the southern states .
the views presented by the postmaster - general against the policy of granting subsidies to the ocean mail steamship lines upon established routes and in favor of continuing the present system , which limits the compensation for ocean service to the postage earnings , are recommended to the careful consideration of congress .
it appears from the report of the secretary of the navy that while at the commencement of the present year there were in commission 530 vessels of all classes and descriptions , armed with 3,000 guns and manned by 51,000 men , the number of vessels at present in commission is 117 , with 830 guns and 12,128 men .
by this prompt reduction of the naval forces the expenses of the government have been largely diminished , and a number of vessels purchased for naval purposes from the merchant marine have been returned to the peaceful pursuits of commerce .
since the suppression of active hostilities our foreign squadrons have been reestablished , and consist of vessels much more efficient than those employed on similar service previous to the rebellion .
the suggestion for the enlargement of the navy - yards , and especially for the establishment of one in fresh water for ironclad vessels , is deserving of consideration , as is also the recommendation for a different location and more ample grounds for the naval academy .
in the report of the secretary of war a general summary is given of the military campaigns of 1864 and 1865 , ending in the suppression of armed resistance to the national authority in the insurgent states .
the operations of the general administrative bureaus of the war department during the past year are detailed and an estimate made of the appropriations that will be required for military purposes in the fiscal year commencing the 1st day of july , 1866 .
the national military force on the 1st of may , 1865 , numbered 1,000,516 men .
it is proposed to reduce the military establishment to a peace footing , comprehending 50,000 troops of all arms , organized so as to admit of an enlargement by filling up the ranks to 82,600 if the circumstances of the country should require an augmentation of the army .
the volunteer force has already been reduced by the discharge from service of over 800,000 troops , and the department is proceeding rapidly in the work of further reduction .
the war estimates are reduced from $ 516,240,131 to $ 33,814,461 , which amount , in the opinion of the department , is adequate for a peace establishment .
the measures of retrenchment in each bureau and branch of the service exhibit a diligent economy worthy of commendation .
reference is also made in the report to the necessity of providing for a uniform militia system and to the propriety of making suitable provision for wounded and disabled officers and soldiers .
the revenue system of the country is a subject of vital interest to its honor and prosperity , and should command the earnest consideration of congress .
the secretary of the treasury will lay before you a full and detailed report of the receipts and disbursements of the last fiscal year , of the first quarter of the present fiscal year , of the probable receipts and expenditures for the other three quarters , and the estimates for the year following the 30th of june , 1866 .
i might content myself with a reference to that report , in which you will find all the information required for your deliberations and decision , but the paramount importance of the subject so presses itself on my own mind that i can not but lay before you my views of the measures which are required for the good character , and i might almost say for the existence , of this people .
the life of a republic lies certainly in the energy , virtue , and intelligence of its citizens ; but it is equally true that a good revenue system is the life of an organized government .
i meet you at a time when the nation has voluntarily burdened itself with a debt unprecedented in our annals .
vast as is its amount , it fades away into nothing when compared with the countless blessings that will be conferred upon our country and upon man by the preservation of the nation 's life .
now , on the first occasion of the meeting of congress since the return of peace , it is of the utmost importance to inaugurate a just policy , which shall at once be put in motion , and which shall commend itself to those who come after us for its continuance .
we must aim at nothing less than the complete effacement of the financial evils that necessarily followed a state of civil war .
we must endeavor to apply the earliest remedy to the deranged state of the currency , and not shrink from devising a policy which , with - out being oppressive to the people , shall immediately begin to effect a reduction of the debt , and , if persisted in , discharge it fully within a definitely fixed number of years .
it is our first duty to prepare in earnest for our recovery from the ever - increasing evils of an irredeemable currency without a sudden revulsion , and yet without untimely procrastination .
for that end we must each , in our respective positions , prepare the way .
i hold it the duty of the executive to insist upon frugality in the expenditures , and a sparing economy is itself a great national resource .
of the banks to which authority has been given to issue notes secured by bonds of the united states we may require the greatest moderation and prudence , and the law must be rigidly enforced when its limits are exceeded .
we may each one of us counsel our active and enterprising countrymen to be constantly on their guard , to liquidate debts contracted in a paper currency , and by conducting business as nearly as possible on a system of cash payments or short credits to hold themselves prepared to return to the standard of gold and silver .
to aid our fellow - citizens in the prudent management of their monetary affairs , the duty devolves on us to diminish by law the amount of paper money now in circulation .
five years ago the bank - note circulation of the country amounted to not much more than two hundred millions ; now the circulation , bank and national , exceeds seven hundred millions .
the simple statement of the fact recommends more strongly than any words of mine could do the necessity of our restraining this expansion .
the gradual reduction of the currency is the only measure that can save the business of the country from disastrous calamities , and this can be almost imperceptibly accomplished by gradually funding the national circulation in securities that may be made redeemable at the pleasure of the government .
our debt is doubly secure -- first in the actual wealth and still greater undeveloped resources of the country , and next in the character of our institutions .
the most intelligent observers among political economists have not failed to remark that the public debt of a country is safe in proportion as its people are free ; that the debt of a republic is the safest of all .
our history confirms and establishes the theory , and is , i firmly believe , destined to give it a still more signal illustration .
the secret of this superiority springs not merely from the fact that in a republic the national obligations are distributed more widely through countless numbers in all classes of society ; it has its root in the character of our laws .
here all men contribute to the public welfare and bear their fair share of the public burdens .
during the war , under the impulses of patriotism , the men of the great body of the people , without regard to their own comparative want of wealth , thronged to our armies and filled our fleets of war , and held themselves ready to offer their lives for the public good .
now , in their turn , the property and income of the country should bear their just proportion of the burden of taxation , while in our impost system , through means of which increased vitality is incidentally imparted to all the industrial interests of the nation , the duties should be so adjusted as to fall most heavily on articles of luxury leaving the necessaries of life as free from taxation as the absolute wants of the government economically administered will justify .
no favored class should demand freedom from assessment , and the taxes should be so distributed as not to fall unduly on the poor , but rather on the accumulated wealth of the country .
we should look at the national debt just as it is -- not as a national blessing , but as a heavy burden on the industry of the country , to be discharged without unnecessary delay .
it is estimated by the secretary of the treasury that the expenditures for the fiscal year ending the 30th of june , 1866 , will exceed the receipts $ 112,194,947 .
it is gratifying , however , to state that it is also estimated that the revenue for the year ending the 30th of june , 1867 , will exceed the expenditures in the sum of $ 111,682,818 .
this amount , or so much as may be deemed sufficient for the purpose , may be applied to the reduction of the public debt , which on the 31st day of october , 1865 , was $ 2,740,854,750 .
every reduction will diminish the total amount of interest to be paid , and so enlarge the means of still further reductions , until the whole shall be liquidated ; and this , as will be seen from the estimates of the secretary of the treasury , may be accomplished by annual payments even within a period not exceeding thirty years .
i have faith that we shall do all this within a reasonable time ; that as we have amazed the world by the suppression of a civil war which was thought to be beyond the control of any government , so we shall equally show the superiority of our institutions by the prompt and faithful discharge of our national obligations .
the department of agriculture under its present direction is accomplishing much in developing and utilizing the vast agricultural capabilities of the country , and for information respecting the details of its management reference is made to the annual report of the commissioner .
i have dwelt thus fully on our domestic affairs because of their transcendent importance .
under any circumstances our great extent of territory and variety of climate , producing almost everything that is necessary for the wants and even the comforts of man , make us singularly independent of the varying policy of foreign powers and protect us against every temptation to " entangling alliances , " while at the present moment the reestablishment of harmony and the strength that comes from harmony will be our best security against " nations who feel power and forget right . "
for myself , it has been and it will be my constant aim to promote peace and amity with all foreign nations and powers , and i have every reason to believe that they all , without exception , are animated by the same disposition .
our relations with the emperor of china , so recent in their origin , are most friendly .
our commerce with his dominions is receiving new developments , and it is very pleasing to find that the government of that great empire manifests satisfaction with our policy and reposes just confidence in the fairness which marks our intercourse .
the unbroken harmony between the united states and the emperor of russia is receiving a new support from an enterprise designed to carry telegraphic lines across the continent of asia , through his dominions , and so to connect us with all europe by a new channel of intercourse .
our commerce with south america is about to receive encouragement by a direct line of mail steamships to the rising empire of brazil .
the distinguished party of men of science who have recently left our country to make a scientific exploration of the natural history and rivers and mountain ranges of that region have received from the emperor that generous welcome which was to have been expected from his constant friendship for the united states and his well - known zeal in promoting the advancement of knowledge .
a hope is entertained that our commerce with the rich and populous countries that border the mediterranean sea may be largely increased .
nothing will be wanting on the part of this government to extend the protection of our flag over the enterprise of our fellow - citizens .
we receive from the powers in that region assurances of good will ; and it is worthy of note that a special envoy has brought us messages of condolence on the death of our late chief magistrate from the bey of tunis , whose rule includes the old dominions of carthage , on the african coast .
our domestic contest , now happily ended , has left some traces in our relations with one at least of the great maritime powers .
the formal accordance of belligerent rights to the insurgent states was unprecedented , and has not been justified by the issue .
but in the systems of neutrality pursued by the powers which made that concession there was a marked difference .
the materials of war for the insurgent states were furnished , in a great measure , from the workshops of great britain , and british ships , manned by british subjects and prepared for receiving british armaments , sallied from the ports of great britain to make war on american commerce under the shelter of a commission from the insurgent states .
these ships , having once escaped from british ports , ever afterwards entered them in every part of the world to refit , and so to renew their depredations .
the consequences of this conduct were most disastrous to the states then in rebellion , increasing their desolation and misery by the prolongation of our civil contest .
it had , moreover , the effect , to a great extent , to drive the american flag from the sea , and to transfer much of our shipping and our commerce to the very power whose subjects had created the necessity for such a change .
these events took place before i was called to the administration of the government .
the sincere desire for peace by which i am animated led me to approve the proposal , already made , to submit the question which had thus arisen between the countries to arbitration .
these questions are of such moment that they must have commanded the attention of the great powers , and are so interwoven with the peace and interests of every one of them as to have insured an impartial decision .
i regret to inform you that great britain declined the arbitrament , but , on the other hand , invited us to the formation of a joint commission to settle mutual claims between the two countries , from which those for the depredations before mentioned should be excluded .
the proposition , in that very unsatisfactory form , has been declined .
the united states did not present the subject as an impeachment of the good faith of a power which was professing the most friendly dispositions , but as involving questions of public law of which the settlement is essential to the peace of nations ; and though pecuniary reparation to their injured citizens would have followed incidentally on a decision against great britain , such compensation was not their primary object .
they had a higher motive , and it was in the interests of peace and justice to establish important principles of international law .
the correspondence will be placed before you .
the ground on which the british minister rests his justification is , substantially , that the municipal law of a nation and the domestic interpretations of that law are the measure of its duty as a neutral , and i feel bound to declare my opinion before you and before the world that that justification can not be sustained before the tribunal of nations .
at the same time ; i do not advise to any present attempt at redress by acts of legislation .
for the future , friendship between the two countries must rest on the basis of mutual justice .
from the moment of the establishment of our free constitution the civilized world has been convulsed by revolutions in the interests of democracy or of monarchy , but through all those revolutions the united states have wisely and firmly refused to become propagandists of republicanism .
it is the only government suited to our condition ; but we have never sought to impose it on others , and we have consistently followed the advice of washington to recommend it only by the careful preservation and prudent use of the blessing .
during all the intervening period the policy of european powers and of the united states has , on the whole , been harmonious .
twice , indeed , rumors of the invasion of some parts of america in the interest of monarchy have prevailed ; twice my predecessors have had occasion to announce the views of this nation in respect to such interference .
on both occasions the remonstrance of the united states was respected from a deep conviction on the part of european governments that the system of noninterference and mutual abstinence from propagandism was the true rule for the two hemispheres .
since those times we have advanced in wealth and power , but we retain the same purpose to leave the nations of europe to choose their own dynasties and form their own systems of government .
this consistent moderation may justly demand a corresponding moderation .
we should regard it as a great calamity to ourselves , to the cause of good government , and to the peace of the world should any european power challenge the american people , as it were , to the defense of republicanism against foreign interference .
we can not foresee and are unwilling to consider what opportunities might present themselves , what combinations might offer to protect ourselves against designs inimical to our form of government .
the united states desire to act in the future as they have ever acted heretofore ; they never will be driven from that course but by the aggression of european powers , and we rely on the wisdom and justice of those powers to respect the system of noninterference which has so long been sanctioned by time , and which by its good results has approved itself to both continents .
the correspondence between the united states and france in reference to questions which have become subjects of discussion between the two governments will at a proper time be laid before congress .
when , on the organization of our government under the constitution , the president of the united states delivered his inaugural address to the two houses of congress , he said to them , and through them to the country and to mankind , that-- 

     the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered , perhaps , as deeply , as finally , staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the american people .
and the house of representatives answered washington by the voice of madison : 

     we adore the invisible hand which has led the american people , through so many difficulties , to cherish a conscious responsibility for the destiny of republican liberty .
more than seventy - six years have glided away since these words were spoken ; the united states have passed through severer trials than were foreseen ; and now , at this new epoch in our existence as one nation , with our union purified by sorrows and strengthened by conflict and established by the virtue of the people , the greatness of the occasion invites us once more to repeat with solemnity the pledges of our fathers to hold ourselves answerable before our fellow - men for the success of the republican form of government .
experience has proved its sufficiency in peace and in war ; it has vindicated its authority through dangers and afflictions , and sudden and terrible emergencies , which would have crushed any system that had been less firmly fixed in the hearts of the people .
at the inauguration of washington the foreign relations of the country were few and its trade was repressed by hostile regulations ; now all the civilized nations of the globe welcome our commerce , and their governments profess toward us amity .
then our country felt its way hesitatingly along an untried path , with states so little bound together by rapid means of communication as to be hardly known to one another , and with historic traditions extending over very few years ; now intercourse between the states is swift and intimate ; the experience of centuries has been crowded into a few generations , and has created an intense , indestructible nationality .
then our jurisdiction did not reach beyond the inconvenient boundaries of the territory which had achieved independence ; now , through cessions of lands , first colonized by spain and france , the country has acquired a more complex character , and has for its natural limits the chain of lakes , the gulf of mexico , and on the east and the west the two great oceans .
other nations were wasted by civil wars for ages before they could establish for themselves the necessary degree of unity ; the latent conviction that our form of government is the best ever known to the world has enabled us to emerge from civil war within four years with a complete vindication of the constitutional authority of the general government and with our local liberties and state institutions unimpaired .
the throngs of emigrants that crowd to our shores are witnesses of the confidence of all peoples in our permanence .
here is the great land of free labor , where industry is blessed with unexampled rewards and the bread of the workingman is sweetened by the consciousness that the cause of the country " is his own cause , his own safety , his own dignity . "
here everyone enjoys the free use of his faculties and the choice of activity as a natural right .
here , under the combined influence of a fruitful soil , genial climes , and happy institutions , population has increased fifteen - fold within a century .
here , through the easy development of boundless resources , wealth has increased with twofold greater rapidity than numbers , so that we have become secure against the financial vicissitudes of other countries and , alike in business and in opinion , are self - centered and truly independent .
here more and more care is given to provide education for everyone born on our soil .
here religion , released from political connection with the civil government , refuses to subserve the craft of statesmen , and becomes in its independence the spiritual life of the people .
here toleration is extended to every opinion , in the quiet certainty that truth needs only a fair field to secure the victory .
here the human mind goes forth unshackled in the pursuit of science , to collect stores of knowledge and acquire an ever - increasing mastery over the forces of nature .
here the national domain is offered and held in millions of separate freeholds , so that our fellow - citizens , beyond the occupants of any other part of the earth , constitute in reality a people .
here exists the democratic form of government ; and that form of government , by the confession of european statesmen , " gives a power of which no other form is capable , because it incorporates every man with the state and arouses everything that belongs to the soul . "
where in past history .
does a parallel exist to the public happiness which is within the reach of the people of the united states ?
where in any part of the globe can institutions be found so suited to their habits or so entitled to their love as their own free constitution ?
every one of them , then , in whatever part of the land he has his home , must wish its perpetuity .
who of them will not now acknowledge , in the words of washington , that " every step by which the people of the united states have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency " ?
who will not join with me in the prayer that the invisible hand which has led us through the clouds that gloomed around our path will so guide us onward to a perfect restoration of fraternal affection that we of this day may be able to transmit our great inheritance of state governments in all their rights , of the general government in its whole constitutional vigor , to our posterity , and they to theirs through countless generations ?

to the house of representatives : 
 i have examined the bill " to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel states " with the care and anxiety which its transcendent importance is calculated to awaken .
i am unable to give it my assent , for reasons so grave that i hope a statement of them may have some influence on the minds of the patriotic and enlightened men with whom the decision must ultimately rest .
the bill places all the people of the ten states therein named under the absolute domination of military rulers ; and the preamble undertakes to give the reason upon which the measure is based and the ground upon which it is justified .
it declares that there exists in those states no legal governments and no adequate protection for life or property , and asserts the necessity of enforcing peace and good order within their limits .
is this true as matter of fact ?
it is not denied that the states in question have each of them an actual government , with all the powers -- executive , judicial , and legislative -- which properly belong to a free state .
they are organized like the other states of the union , and , like them , they make , administer , and execute the laws which concern their domestic affairs .
an existing de facto government , exercising such functions as these , is itself the law of the state upon all matters within its jurisdiction .
to pronounce the supreme lawmaking power of an established state illegal is to say that law itself is unlawful .
the provisions which these governments have made for the preservation of order , the suppression of crime , and the redress of private injuries are in substance and principle the same as those which prevail in the northern states and in other civilized countries .
they certainly have not succeeded in preventing the commission of all crime , nor has this been accomplished anywhere in the world .
there , as well as elsewhere , offenders sometimes escape for want of vigorous prosecution , and occasionally , perhaps , by the inefficiency of courts or the prejudice of jurors .
it is undoubtedly true that these evils have been much increased and aggravated , north and south , by the demoralizing influences of civil war and by the rancorous passions which the contest has engendered .
but that these people are maintaining local governments for themselves which habitually defeat the object of all government and render their own lives and property insecure is in itself utterly improbable , and the averment of the bill to that effect is not supported by any evidence which has come to my knowledge .
all the information i have on the subject convinces me that the masses of the southern people and those who control their public acts , while they entertain diverse opinions on questions of federal policy , are completely united in the effort to reorganize their society on the basis of peace and to restore their mutual prosperity as rapidly and as completely as their circumstances will permit .
the bill , however , would seem to show upon its face that the establishment of peace and good order is not its real object .
the fifth section declares that the preceding sections shall cease to operate in any state where certain events shall have happened .
these events are , first , the selection of delegates to a state convention by an election at which negroes shall be allowed to vote ; second , the formation of a state constitution by the convention so chosen ; third , the insertion into the state constitution of a provision which will secure the right of voting at all elections to negroes and to such white men as may not be disfranchised for rebellion or felony ; fourth , the submission of the constitution for ratification to negroes and white men not disfranchised , and its actual ratification by their vote ; fifth , the submission of the state constitution to congress for examination and approval , and the actual approval of it by that body ; sixth , the adoption of a certain amendment to the federal constitution by a vote of the legislature elected under the new constitution ; seventh , the adoption of said amendment by a sufficient number of other states to make it a part of the constitution of the united states .
all these conditions must be fulfilled before the people of any of these states can be relieved from the bondage of military domination ; but when they are fulfilled , then immediately the pains and penalties of the bill are to cease , no matter whether there be peace and order or not , and without any reference to the security of life or property .
the excuse given for the bill in the preamble is admitted by the bill itself not to be real .
the military rule which it establishes is plainly to be used , not for any purpose of order or for the prevention of crime , but solely as a means of coercing the people into the adoption of principles and measures to which it is known that they are opposed , and upon which they have an undeniable right to exercise their own judgment .
i submit to congress whether this measure is not in its whole character , scope , and object without precedent and without authority , in palpable conflict with the plainest provisions of the constitution , and utterly destructive to those great principles of liberty and humanity for which our ancestors on both sides of the atlantic have shed so much blood and expended so much treasure .
the ten states named in the bill are divided into five districts .
for each district an officer of the army , not below the rank of a brigadier - general , is to be appointed to rule over the people ; and he is to be supported with an efficient military force to enable him to perform his duties and enforce his authority .
those duties and that authority , as defined by the third section of the bill , are " to protect all persons in their rights of person and property , to suppress insurrection , disorder , and violence , and to punish or cause to be punished all disturbers of the public peace or criminals . "
the power thus given to the commanding officer over all the people of each district is that of an absolute monarch .
his mere will is to take the place of all law .
the law of the states is now the only rule applicable to the subjects placed under his control , and that is completely displaced by the clause which declares all interference of state authority to be null and void .
he alone is permitted to determine what are rights of person or property , and he may protect them in such way as in his discretion may seem proper .
it places at his free disposal all the lands and goods in his district , and he may distribute them without let or hindrance to whom he pleases .
being bound by no state law , and there being no other law to regulate the subject , he may make a criminal code of his own ; and he can make it as bloody as any recorded in history , or he can reserve the privilege of acting upon the impulse of his private passions in each case that arises .
he is bound by no rules of evidence ; there is , indeed , no provision by which he is authorized or required to take any evidence at all .
everything is a crime which he chooses to call so , and all persons are condemned whom he pronounces to be guilty .
he is not bound to keep any record or make any report of his proceedings .
he may arrest his victims wherever he finds them , without warrant , accusation , or proof of probable cause .
if he gives them a trial before he inflicts the punishment , he gives it of his grace and mercy , not because he is commanded so to do .
to a casual reader of the bill it might seem that some kind of trial was secured by it to persons accused of crime , but such is not the case .
the officer " may allow local civil tribunals to try offenders , " but of course this does not require that he shall do so .
if any state or federal court presumes to exercise its legal jurisdiction by the trial of a malefactor without his special permission , he can break it up and punish the judges and jurors as being themselves malefactors .
he can save his friends from justice , and despoil his enemies contrary to justice .
it is also provided that " he shall have power to organize military commissions or tribunals ; " but this power he is not commanded to exercise .
it is merely permissive , and is to be used only " when in his judgment it may be necessary for the trial of offenders . "
even if the sentence of a commission were made a prerequisite to the punishment of a party , it would be scarcely the slightest check upon the officer , who has authority to organize it as he pleases , prescribe its mode of proceeding , appoint its members from his own subordinates , and revise all its decisions .
instead of mitigating the harshness of his single rule , such a tribunal would be used much more probably to divide the responsibility of making it more cruel and unjust .
several provisions dictated by the humanity of congress have been inserted in the bill , apparently to restrain the power of the commanding officer ; but it seems to me that they are of no avail for that purpose .
the fourth section provides : first .
that trials shall not be unnecessarily delayed ; but i think i have shown that the power is given to punish without trial ; and if so , this provision is practically inoperative .
second .
cruel or unusual punishment is not to be inflicted ; but who is to decide what is cruel and what is unusual ?
the words have acquired a legal meaning by long use in the courts .
can it be expected that military officers will understand or follow a rule expressed in language so purely technical and not pertaining in the least degree to their profession ?
if not , then each officer may define cruelty according to his own temper , and if it is not usual he will make it usual .
corporal punishment , imprisonment , the gag , the ball and chain , and all the almost insupportable forms of torture invented for military punishment lie within the range of choice .
third .
the sentence of a commission is not to be executed without being approved by the commander , if it affects life or liberty , and a sentence of death must be approved by the president .
this applies to eases in which there has been a trial and sentence .
i take it to be clear , under this bill , that the military commander may condemn to death without even the form of a trial by a military commission , so that the life of the condemned may depend upon the will of two men instead of one .
it is plain that the authority here given to the military officer amounts to absolute despotism .
but to make it still more unendurable , the bill provides that it may be delegated to as many subordinates as he chooses to appoint , for it declares that he shall " punish or cause to be punished . "
such a power has not been wielded by any monarch in england for more than five hundred years .
in all that time no people who speak the english language have borne such servitude .
it reduces the whole population of the ten states -- all persons , of every color , sex , and condition , and every stranger within their limits -- to the most abject and degrading slavery .
no master ever had a control so absolute over the slaves as this bill gives to the military officers over both white and colored persons .
it may be answered to this that the officers of the army are too magnanimous , just , and humane to oppress and trample upon a subjugated people .
i do not doubt that army officers are as well entitled to this kind of confidence as any other class of men .
but the history of the world has been written in vain if it does not teach us that unrestrained authority can never be safely trusted in human hands .
it is almost sure to be more or less abused under any circumstances , and it has always resulted in gross tyranny where the rulers who exercise it are strangers to their subjects and come among them as the representatives of a distant power , and more especially when the power that sends them is unfriendly .
governments closely resembling that here proposed have been fairly tried in hungary and poland , and the suffering endured by those people roused the sympathies of the entire world .
it was tried in ireland , and , though tempered at first by principles of english law , it gave birth to cruelties so atrocious that they are never recounted without just indignation .
the french convention armed its deputies with this power and sent them to the southern departments of the republic .
the massacres , murders , and other atrocities which they committed show what the passions of the ablest men in the most civilized society will tempt them to do when wholly unrestrained by law .
the men of our race in every age have struggled to tie up the hands of their governments and keep them within the law , because their own experience of all mankind taught them that rulers could not be relied on to concede those rights which they were not legally bound to respect .
the head of a great empire has sometimes governed it with a mild and paternal sway , but the kindness of an irresponsible deputy never yields what the law does not extort from him .
between such a master and the people subjected to his domination there can be nothing but enmity ; he punishes them if they resist his authority , and if they submit to it he hates them for their servility .
i come now to a question which is , if possible , still more important .
have we the power to establish and carry into execution a measure like this ?
i answer , certainly not , if we derive our authority from the constitution and if we are bound by the limitations which it imposes .
this proposition is perfectly clear , that no branch of the federal government executive , legislative , or judicial -- can have any just powers except those which it derives through and exercises under the organic law of the union .
outside of the constitution we have no legal authority more than private citizens , and within it we have only so much as that instrument gives us .
this broad principle limits all our functions and applies to all subjects .
it protects not only the citizens of states which are within the union , but it shields every human being who comes or is brought under our jurisdiction .
we have no right to do in one place more than in another that which the constitution says we shall not do at all .
if , therefore , the southern states were in truth out of the union , we could not treat their people in a way which the fundamental law forbids .
some persons assume that the success of our arms in crushing the opposition which was made in some of the states to the execution of the federal laws reduced those states and all their people -- the innocent as well as the guilty -- to the condition of vassalage and gave us a power over them which the constitution does not bestow or define or limit .
no fallacy can be more transparent than this .
our victories subjected the insurgents to legal obedience , not to the yoke of an arbitrary despotism .
when an absolute sovereign reduces his rebellious subjects , he may deal with them according to his pleasure , because he had that power before .
but when a limited monarch puts down an insurrection , he must still govern according to law .
if an insurrection should take place in one of our states against the authority of the state government and end in the overthrow of those who planned it , would that take away the rights of all the people of the counties where it was favored by a part or a majority of the population ?
could they for such a reason be wholly outlawed and deprived of their representation in the legislature ?
i have always contended that the government of the united states was sovereign within its constitutional sphere ; that it executed its laws , like the states themselves , by applying its coercive power directly to individuals , and that it could put down insurrection with the same effect as a state and no other .
the opposite doctrine is the worst heresy of those who advocated secession , and can not be agreed to without admitting that heresy to be right .
invasion , insurrection , rebellion , and domestic violence were anticipated when the government was framed , and the means of repelling and suppressing them were wisely provided for in the constitution ; but it was not thought necessary to declare that the states in which they might occur should be expelled from the union .
rebellions , which were invariably suppressed , occurred prior to that out of which these questions grow ; but the states continued to exist and the union remained unbroken .
in massachusetts , in pennsylvania , in rhode island , and in new york , at different periods in our history , violent and armed opposition to the united states was earned on ; but the relations of those states with the federal government were not supposed to be interrupted or changed thereby after the rebellions portions of their population were defeated and put down .
it is true that in these earlier cases there was no formal expression of a determination to withdraw from the union , but it is also true that in the southern states the ordinances of secession were treated by all the friends of the union as mere nullities and are now acknowledged to be so by the states themselves .
if we admit that they had any force or validity or that they did in fact take the states in which they were passed out of the union , we sweep from under our feet all the grounds upon which we stand in justifying the use of federal force to maintain the integrity of the government .
this is a bill passed by congress in time of peace .
there is not in any one of the states brought under its operation either war or insurrection .
the laws of the states and of the federal government are all in undisturbed and harmonious operation .
the courts , state and federal , are open and in the full exercise of their proper authority .
over every state comprised in these five military districts , life , liberty , and property are secured by state laws and federal laws , and the national constitution is everywhere in force and everywhere obeyed .
what , then , is the ground on which this bill proceeds ?
the title of the bill announces that it is intended " for the more efficient government " of these ten states .
it is recited by way of preamble that no legal state governments " nor adequate protection for life or property " exist in those states , and that peace and good order should be thus enforced .
the first thing which arrests attention upon these recitals , which prepare the way for martial law , is this , that the only foundation upon which martial law can exist under our form of government is not stated or so much as pretended .
actual war , foreign invasion , domestic insurrection -- none of these appear ; and none of these , in fact , exist .
it is not even recited that any sort of war or insurrection is threatened .
let us pause here to consider , upon this question of constitutional law and the power of congress , a recent decision of the supreme court of the united states in ex parte milligan .
i will first quote from the opinion of the majority of the court : 
 martial law can not arise from a threatened invasion .
the necessity must be actual and present , the invasion real , such as effectually closes the courts and deposes the civil administration .
we see that martial law comes in only when actual war closes the courts and deposes the civil authority ; but this bill , in time of peace , makes martial law operate as though we were in actual war , and becomes the cause instead of the consequence of the abrogation of civil authority .
one more quotation : 
 it follows from what has been said on this subject that there are occasions when martial law can be properly applied .
if in foreign invasion or civil war the courts are actually closed , and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law , then , on the theater of active military operations , where war really prevails , there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority thus overthrown , to preserve the safety of the army and society ; and as no power is left but the military , it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course .
i now quote from the opinion of the minority of the court , delivered by chief justice chase : 
 we by no means assert that congress can establish and apply the laws of war where no war has been declared or exists .
where peace exists , the laws of peace must prevail .
this is sufficiently explicit .
peace exists in all the territory to which this bill applies .
it asserts a power in congress , in time of peace , to set aside the laws of peace and to substitute the laws of war .
the minority , concurring with the majority , declares that congress does not possess that power .
again , and , if possible , more emphatically , the chief justice , with remarkable clearness and condensation , sums up the whole matter as follows : 
 there are under the constitution three kinds of military jurisdiction -- one to be exercised both in peace and war ; another to be exercised in time of foreign war without the boundaries of the united states , or in time of rebellion and civil war within states or districts occupied by rebels treated as belligerents ; and a third to be exercised in time of invasion or insurrection within the limits of the united states , or during rebellion within the limits of the states maintaining adhesion to the national government , when the public danger requires its exercise .
the first of these may be called jurisdiction under military law , and is found in acts of congress prescribing rules and articles of war or otherwise providing for the government of the national forces ; the second may be distinguished as military government , superseding as far as may be deemed expedient the local law , and exercised by the military commander under the direction of the president , with the express or implied sanction of congress ; while the third may be denominated martial law proper , and is called into action by congress , or temporarily , when the action of congress can not be invited , and in the case of justifying or excusing peril , by the president , in times of insurrection or invasion or of civil or foreign war , within districts or localities where ordinary law no longer adequately secures public safety and private rights .
it will be observed that of the three kinds of military jurisdiction which can be exercised or created under our constitution there is but one that can prevail in time of peace , and that is the code of laws enacted by congress for the government of the national forces .
that body of military law has no application to the citizen , nor even to the citizen soldier enrolled in the militia in time of peace .
but this bill is not a part of that sort of military law , for that applies only to the soldier and not to the citizen , whilst , contrariwise , the military law provided by this bill applies only to the citizen and not to the soldier .
i need not say to the representatives of the american people that their constitution forbids the exercise of judicial power in any way but one -- that is , by the ordained and established courts .
it is equally well known that in all criminal cases a trial by jury is made indispensable by the express words of that instrument .
i will not enlarge on the inestimable value of the right thus secured to every freeman or speak of the danger to public liberty in all parts of the country which must ensue from a denial of it anywhere or upon any pretense .
a very recent decision of the supreme court has traced the history , vindicated the dignity , and made known the value of this great privilege so clearly that nothing more is needed .
to what extent a violation of it might be excused in time of war or public danger may admit of discussion , but we are providing now for a time of profound peace , when there is not an armed soldier within our borders except those who are in the service of the government .
it is in such a condition of things that an act of congress is proposed which , if carried out , would deny a trial by the lawful courts and juries to 9,000,000 american citizens and to their posterity for an indefinite period .
it seems to be scarcely possible that anyone should seriously believe this consistent with a constitution which declares in simple , plain , and unambiguous language that all persons shall have that right and that no person shall ever in any case be deprived of it .
the constitution also forbids the arrest of the citizen without judicial warrant , rounded on probable cause .
this bill authorizes an arrest without warrant , at the pleasure of a military commander .
the constitution declares that " no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on presentment by a grand jury . "
this bill holds every person not a soldier answerable for all crimes and all charges without any presentment .
the constitution declares that " no person shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property without due process of law . "
this bill sets aside all process of law , and makes the citizen answerable in his person and property to the will of one man , and as to his life to the will of two .
finally , the constitution declares that " the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when , in case of rebellion or invasion , the public safety may require it ; " whereas this bill declares martial law ( which of itself suspends this great writ ) in time of peace , and authorizes the military to make the arrest , and gives to the prisoner only one privilege , and that is a trial " without unnecessary delay . "
he has no hope of release from custody , except the hope , such as it is , of release by acquittal before a military commission .
the united states are bound to guarantee to each state a republican form of government .
can it be pretended that this obligation is not palpably broken if we carry out a measure like this , which wipes away every vestige of republican government in ten states and puts the life , property , liberty , and honor of all the people in each of them under the domination of a single person clothed with unlimited authority ?
the parliament of england , exercising the omnipotent power which it claimed , was accustomed to pass bills of attainder ; that is to say , it would convict men of treason and other crimes by legislative enactment .
the person accused had a hearing , sometimes a patient and fair one , but generally party prejudice prevailed instead of justice .
it often became necessary for parliament to acknowledge its error and reverse its own action .
the fathers of our country determined that no such thing should occur here .
they withheld the power from congress , and thus forbade its exercise by that body , and they provided in the constitution that no state should pass any bill of attainder .
it is therefore impossible for any person in this country to be constitutionally convicted or punished for any crime by a legislative proceeding of any sort .
nevertheless , here is a bill of attainder against 9,000,000 people at once .
it is based upon an accusation so vague as to be scarcely intelligible and found to be true upon no credible evidence .
not one of the 9,000,000 was heard in his own defense .
the representatives of the doomed parties were excluded from all participation in the trial .
the conviction is to be followed by the most ignominious punishment ever inflicted on large masses of men .
it disfranchises them by hundreds of thousands and degrades them all , even those who are admitted to be guiltless , from the rank of freemen to the condition of slaves .
the purpose and object of the bill -- the general intent which pervades it from beginning to end -- is to change the entire structure and character of the state governments and to compel them by force to the adoption of organic laws and regulations which they are unwilling to accept if left to themselves .
the negroes have not asked for the privilege of voting ; the vast majority of them have no idea what it means .
this bill not only thrusts it into their hands , but compels them , as well as the whites , to use it in a particular way .
if they do not form a constitution with prescribed articles in it and afterwards elect a legislature which will act upon certain measures in a prescribed way , neither blacks nor whites can be relieved from the slavery which the bill imposes upon them .
without pausing here to consider the policy or impolicy of africanizing the southern part of our territory , i would simply ask the attention of congress to that manifest , well - known , and universally acknowledged rule of constitutional law which declares that the federal government has no jurisdiction , authority , or power to regulate such subjects for any state .
to force the right of suffrage out of the hands of the white people and into the hands of the negroes is an arbitrary violation of this principle .
this bill imposes martial law at once , and its operations will begin so soon as the general and his troops can be put in place .
the dread alternative between its harsh rule and compliance with the terms of this measure is not suspended , nor are the people afforded any time for free deliberation .
the bill says to them , take martial law first , then deliberate .
and when they have done all that this measure requires them to do other conditions and contingencies over which they have no control yet remain to be fulfilled before they can be relieved from martial law .
another congress must first approve the constitution made in conformity with the will of this congress and must declare these states entitled to representation in both houses .
the whole question thus remains open and unsettled and must again occupy the attention of congress ; and in the meantime the agitation which now prevails will continue to disturb all portions of the people .
the bill also denies the legality of the governments of ten of the states which participated in the ratification of the amendment to the federal constitution abolishing slavery forever within the jurisdiction of the united states and practically excludes them from the union .
if this assumption of the bill be correct , their concurrence can not be considered as having been legally given , and the important fact is made to appear that the consent of three - fourths of the states -- the requisite number -- has not been constitutionally obtained to the ratification of that amendment , thus leaving the question of slavery where it stood before the amendment was officially declared to have become a part of the constitution .
that the measure proposed by this bill does violate the constitution in the particulars mentioned and in many other ways which i forbear to enumerate is too clear to admit of the least doubt .
it only remains to consider whether the injunctions of that instrument ought to be obeyed or not .
i think they ought to be obeyed , for reasons which i will proceed to give as briefly as possible .
in the first place , it is the only system of free government which we can hope to have as a nation .
when it ceases to be the rule of our conduct , we may perhaps take our choice between complete anarchy , a consolidated despotism , and a total dissolution of the union ; but national liberty regulated by law will have passed beyond our reach .
it is the best frame of government the world ever saw .
no other is or can be so well adapted to the genius , habits , or wants of the american people .
combining the strength of a great empire with unspeakable blessings of local self - government , having a central power to defend the general interests , and recognizing the authority of the states as the guardians of industrial rights , it is " the sheet anchor of our safety abroad and our peace at home . "
it was ordained " to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , promote the general welfare , provide for the common defense , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity . "
these great ends have been attained heretofore , and will be again by faithful obedience to it ; but they are certain to be lost if we treat with disregard its sacred obligations .
it was to punish the gross crime of defying the constitution and to vindicate its supreme authority that we carried on a bloody war of four years ' duration .
shall we now acknowledge that we sacrificed a million of lives and expended billions of treasure to enforce a constitution which is not worthy of respect and preservation ?
those who advocated the right of secession alleged in their own justification that we had no regard for law and that their rights of property , life , and liberty would not be safe under the constitution as administered by us .
if we now verify their assertion , we prove that they were in truth and in fact fighting for their liberty , and instead of branding their leaders with the dishonoring name of traitors against a righteous and legal government we elevate them in history to the rank of self - sacrificing patriots , consecrate them to the admiration of the world , and place them by the side of washington , hampden , and sidney .
no ; let us leave them to the infamy they deserve , punish them as they should be punished , according to law , and take upon ourselves no share of the odium which they should bear alone .
it is a part of our public history which can never be forgotten that both houses of congress , in july , 1861 , declared in the form of a solemn resolution that the war was and should be carried on for no purpose of subjugation , but solely to enforce the constitution and laws , and that when this was yielded by the parties in rebellion the contest should cease , with the constitutional rights of the states and of individuals unimpaired .
this resolution was adopted and sent forth to the world unanimously by the senate and with only two dissenting voices in the house .
it was accepted by the friends of the union in the south as well as in the north as expressing honestly and truly the object of the war .
on the faith of it many thousands of persons in both sections gave their lives and their fortunes to the cause .
to repudiate it now by refusing to the states and to the individuals within them the rights which the constitution and laws of the union would secure to them is a breach of our plighted honor for which i can imagine no excuse and to which i can not voluntarily become a party .
the evils which spring from the unsettled state of our government will be acknowledged by all .
commercial intercourse is impeded , capital is in constant peril , public securities fluctuate in value , peace itself is not secure , and the sense of moral and political duty is impaired .
to avert these calamities from our country it is imperatively required that we should immediately decide upon some course of administration which can be steadfastly adhered to .
i am thoroughly convinced that any settlement or compromise or plan of action which is inconsistent with the principles of the constitution will not only be unavailing , but mischievous ; that it will but multiply the present evils , instead of removing them .
the constitution , in its whole integrity and vigor , throughout the length and breadth of the land , is the best of all compromises .
besides , our duty does not , in my judgment , leave us a choice between that and any other .
i believe that it contains the remedy that is so much needed , and that if the coordinate branches of the government would unite upon its provisions they would be found broad enough and strong enough to sustain in time of peace the nation which they bore safely through the ordeal of a protracted civil war .
among the most sacred guaranties of that instrument are those which declare that " each state shall have at least one representative , " and that " no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate . "
each house is made the " judge of the elections , returns , and qualifications of its own members , " and may , " with the concurrence of two - thirds , expel a member . "
thus , as heretofore urged , " in the admission of senators and representatives from any and all of the states there can be no just ground of apprehension that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation , for this could not happen when the constitution and the laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful congress . " "
when a senator or representative presents his certificate of election , he may at once be admitted or rejected ; or , should there be any question as to his eligibility , his credentials may be referred for investigation to the appropriate committee .
if admitted to a seat , it must be upon evidence satisfactory to the house of which he thus becomes a member that he possesses the requisite constitutional and legal qualifications .
if refused admission as a member for want of due allegiance to the government , and returned to his constituents , they are admonished that none but persons loyal to the united states will be allowed a voice in the legislative councils of the nation , and the political power and moral influence of congress are thus effectively exerted in the interests of loyalty to the government and fidelity to the union . "
and is it not far better that the work of restoration should be accomplished by simple compliance with the plain requirements of the constitution than by a recourse to measures which in effect destroy the states and threaten the subversion of the general government ?
all that is necessary to settle this simple but important question without further agitation or delay is a willingness on the part of all to sustain the constitution and carry its provisions into practical operation .
if to - morrow either branch of congress would declare that upon the presentation of their credentials members constitutionally elected and loyal to the general government would be admitted to seats in congress , while all others would be excluded and their places remain vacant until the selection by the people of loyal and qualified persons , and if at the same time assurance were given that this policy would be continued until all the states were represented in congress , it would send a thrill of joy throughout the entire land , as indicating the inauguration of a system which must speedily bring tranquillity to the public mind .
while we are legislating upon subjects which are of great importance to the whole people , and which must affect all parts of the country , not only during the life of the present generation , but for ages to come , we should remember that all men are entitled at least to a hearing in the councils which decide upon the destiny of themselves and their children .
at present ten states are denied representation , and when the fortieth congress assembles on the 4th day of the present month sixteen states will be without a voice in the house of representatives .
this grave fact , with the important questions before us , should induce us to pause in a course of legislation which , looking solely to the attainment of political ends , fails to consider the rights it transgresses , the law which it violates , or the institutions which it imperils .

by the president of the united states of america 
 a proclamation 
 whereas in the month of july , a. d. 1861 , the two houses of congress , with extraordinary unanimity , solemnly declared that the war then existing was not waged on the part of the government in any spirit of oppression nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation , nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of the states , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the constitution and to preserve the union , with all the dignity , equality , and rights of the several states unimpaired , and that as soon as these objects should be accomplished the war ought to cease ; and 
 whereas the president of the united states , on the 8th day of december , a. d. 1863 , and on the 26th day of march , a. d. 1864 , did , with the objects of suppressing the then existing rebellion , of inducing all persons to return to their loyalty , and of restoring the authority of the united states , issue proclamations offering amnesty and pardon to all persons who had , directly or indirectly , participated in the then existing rebellion , except as in those proclamations was specified and reserved ; and 
 whereas the president of the united states did on the 29th day of may , a. d. 1865 , issue a further proclamation , with the same objects before mentioned , and to the end that the authority of the government of the united states might be restored and that peace , order , and freedom might be established , and the president did by the said last - mentioned proclamation proclaim and declare that he thereby granted to all persons who had , directly or indirectly , participated in the then existing rebellion , except as therein excepted , amnesty and pardon , with restoration of all rights of property , except as to slaves , and except in certain cases where legal proceedings had been instituted , but upon condition that such persons should take and subscribe an oath therein prescribed , which oath should be registered for permanent preservation ; and 
 whereas in and by the said last - mentioned proclamation of the 29th day of may , a. d. 1865 , fourteen extensive classes of persons therein specially described were altogether excepted and excluded from the benefits thereof ; and 
 whereas the president of the united states did , on the 2d day of april , a. d. 1866 , issue a proclamation declaring that the insurrection was at an end and was thenceforth to be so regarded ; and 
 whereas there now exists no organized armed resistance of misguided citizens or others to the authority of the united states in the states of georgia , south carolina , virginia , north carolina , tennessee , alabama , louisiana , arkansas , mississippi , florida , and texas , and the laws can be sustained and enforced therein by the proper civil authority , state or federal , and the people of said states are well and loyally disposed , and have conformed , or , if permitted to do so , will conform in their legislation to the condition of affairs growing out of the amendment to the constitution of the united states prohibiting slavery within the limits and jurisdiction of the united states ; and 
 whereas there no longer exists any reasonable ground to apprehend within the states which were involved in the late rebellion any renewal thereof or any unlawful resistance by the people of said states to the constitution and laws of the united states ; and 
 whereas large standing armies , military occupation , martial law , military tribunals , and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and the right of trial by jury are in time of peace dangerous to public liberty , incompatible with the individual rights of the citizen , contrary to the genius and spirit of our free institutions , and exhaustive of the national resources , and ought not , therefore , to be sanctioned or allowed except in cases of actual necessity for repelling invasion or suppressing insurrection or rebellion ; and 
 whereas a retaliatory or vindictive policy , attended by unnecessary disqualifications , pains , penalties , confiscations , and disfranchisements , now , as always , could only tend to hinder reconciliation among the people and national restoration , while it must seriously embarrass , obstruct , and repress popular energies and national industry and enterprise ; and 
 whereas for these reasons it is now deemed essential to the public welfare and to the more perfect restoration of constitutional law and order that the said last - mentioned proclamation so as aforesaid issued on the 29th day of may , a. d. 1865 , should be modified , and that the full and beneficent pardon conceded thereby should be opened and further extended to a large number of the persons who by its aforesaid exceptions have been hitherto excluded from executive clemency : 
 now , therefore , be it known that i , andrew johnson , president of the united states , do hereby proclaim and declare that the full pardon described in the said proclamation of the 29th day of may , a. d. 1865 , shall henceforth be opened and extended to all persons who , directly or indirectly , participated in the late rebellion , with the restoration of all privileges , immunities , and rights of property , except as to property with regard to slaves , and except in cases of legal proceedings under the laws of the united states ; but upon this condition , nevertheless , that every such person who shall seek to avail himself of this proclamation shall take and subscribe the following oath and shall cause the same to be registered for permanent preservation in the same manner and with the same effect as with the oath prescribed in the said proclamation of the 29th day of may , 1865 , namely : 
 i , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) , in presence of almighty god , that i will henceforth faithfully support , protect , and defend the constitution of the united states and the union of the states thereunder , and that i will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all laws and proclamations which have been made during the late rebellion with reference to the emancipation of slaves .
so help me god .
the following persons , and no others , are excluded from the benefits of this proclamation and of the said proclamation of the 29th day of may , 1865 , namely : 
 first .
the chief or pretended chief executive officers , including the president , the vice - president , and all heads of departments of the pretended confederate or rebel government , and all who were agents thereof in foreign states and countries , and all who held or pretended to hold in the service of the said pretended confederate government a military rank or title above the grade of brigadier - general or naval rank or title above that of captain , and all who were or pretended to be governors of states while maintaining , aiding , abetting , or submitting to and acquiescing in the rebellion .
second .
all persons who in any way treated otherwise than as lawful prisoners of war persons who in any capacity were employed or engaged in the military or naval service of the united states .
third .
all persons who at the time they may seek to obtain the benefits of this proclamation are actually in civil , military , or naval confinement or custody , or legally held to bail , either before or after conviction , and all persons who were engaged , directly or indirectly , in the assassination of the late president of the united states or in any plot or conspiracy in any manner therewith connected .
in testimony whereof i have signed these presents with my hand and have caused the seal of the united states to be hereunto affixed .
done at the city of washington , the 7th day of september , a. d. 1867 , and of the independence of the united states of america the ninety - second .
andrew johnson .
by the president : 
 william h. seward , 
 secretary of state .

to the senate of the united states : 
 i have considered , with such care as the pressure of other duties has permitted , a bill entitled " an act to amend an act entitled ' an act to amend the judiciary act , passed the 24th of september , 1789 . ' "
not being able to approve all of its provisions , i herewith return it to the senate , in which house it originated , with a brief statement of my objections .
the first section of the bill meets my approbation , as , for the purpose of protecting the rights of property from the erroneous decision of inferior judicial tribunals , it provides means for obtaining uniformity , by appeal to the supreme court of the united states , in cases which have now become very numerous and of much public interest , and in which such remedy is not now allowed .
the second section , however , takes away the right of appeal to that court in cases which involve the life and liberty of the citizen , and leaves them exposed to the judgment of numerous interior tribunals .
it is apparent that the two sections were conceived in a very , different spirit , and i regret that my objections to one impose upon me the necessity of withholding my sanction from the other .
i can not give my assent to a measure which proposes to deprive any person " restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution or of any treaty .
or law of the united states " from the right of appeal to the highest judicial authority known to our government .
to " secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity " is one of the declared objects of the federal constitution .
to assure these , guaranties are provided in the same instrument , as well against " unreasonable searches and seizures " as against the suspensions of " the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , * * * unless when , in cases of rebellion or invasion , the public safety may require it . "
it was doubtless to afford the people the means of protecting and enforcing these inestimable privileges that the jurisdiction which this bill proposes to take away was conferred upon the supreme court of the nation .
the act conferring that jurisdiction was approved on the 5th day of february , 1867 , with a full knowledge of the motives that prompted its passage , and because it was believed to be necessary and right .
nothing has since occurred to disprove the wisdom and justness of the measures , and to modify it as now proposed would be to lessen the protection of the citizen from the exercise of arbitrary power and to weaken the safeguards of life and liberty , which can never be made too secure against illegal encroachments .
the bill not only prohibits the adjudication by the supreme court of cases in which appeals may hereafter be taken , but interdicts its jurisdiction on appeals which have already been made to that high judicial body .
if , therefore , it should become a law , it will by its retroactive operation wrest from the citizen a remedy which he enjoyed at the time of his appeal .
it will thus operate most harshly upon those who believe that justice has been denied them in the inferior courts .
the legislation proposed in the second section , it seems to me , is not in harmony with the spirit and intention of the constitution .
it can not fail to affect most injuriously the just equipoise of our system of government , for it establishes a precedent which , if followed , may eventually sweep away every check on arbitrary and unconstitutional legislation .
thus far during the existence of the government the supreme court of the united states has been viewed by the people as the true expounder of their constitution , and in the most violent party conflicts its judgments and decrees have always been sought and deferred to with confidence and respect .
in public estimation it combines judicial wisdom and impartiality in a greater degree than any other authority known to the constitution , and any act which may be construed into or mistaken for an attempt to prevent or evade its decision on a question which affects the liberty of the citizens and agitates the country can not fail to be attended with unpropitious consequences .
it will be justly held by a large portion of the people as an admission of the unconstitutionality of the act on which its judgment may be forbidden or forestalled , and may interfere with that willing acquiescence in its provisions which is necessary for the harmonious and efficient execution of any law .
for these reasons , thus briefly and imperfectly stated , and for others , of which want of time forbids the enumeration , i deem it my duty to withhold my assent from this bill , and to return it for the reconsideration of congress .

to the senate of the united states : 
 i have given to the joint resolution entitled " a resolution excluding from the electoral college the votes of states lately in rebellion which shall not have been reorganized " as careful examination as i have been able to bestow upon the subject during the few days that have intervened since the measure was submitted for my approval .
feeling constrained to withhold my consent , i herewith return the resolution to the senate , in which house it originated , with a brief statement of the reasons which have induced my action .
this joint resolution is based upon the assumption that some of the states whose inhabitants were lately in rebellion are not now entitled to representation in congress and participation in the election of president and vice - president of the united states .
having heretofore had occasion to give in detail my reasons for dissenting from this view , it is not necessary at this time to repeat them .
it is sufficient to state that i continue strong in my conviction that the acts of secession , by which a number of the states sought to dissolve their connection with the other states and to subvert the union , being unauthorized by the constitution and in direct violation thereof , were from the beginning absolutely null and void .
it follows necessarily that when the rebellion terminated the several states which had attempted to secede continued to be states in the union , and all that was required to enable them to resume their relations to the union was that they should adopt the measures necessary to their practical restoration as states .
such measures were adopted , and the legitimate result was that those states , having conformed to all the requirements of the constitution , resumed their former relations , and became entitled to the exercise of all the rights guaranteed to them by its provisions .
the joint resolution under consideration , however , seems to assume that by the insurrectionary acts of their respective inhabitants those states forfeited their rights as such , and can never again exercise them except upon readmission into the union on the terms prescribed by congress .
if this position be correct , it follows that they were taken out of the union by virtue of their acts of secession , and hence that the war waged upon them was illegal and unconstitutional .
we would thus be placed in this inconsistent attitude , that while the war was commenced and carried on upon the distinct ground that the southern states , being component parts of the union , were in rebellion against the lawful authority of the united states , upon its termination we resort to a policy of reconstruction which assumes that it was not in fact a rebellion , but that the war was waged for the conquest of territories assumed to be outside of the constitutional union .
the mode and manner of receiving and counting the electoral votes for president and vice - president of the united states are in plain and simple terms prescribed by the constitution .
that instrument imperatively requires that " the president of the senate shall , in the presence of the senate and house of representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . "
congress has , therefore , no power , under the constitution , to receive the electoral votes or reject them .
the whole power is exhausted when , in the presence of the two houses , the votes are counted and the result declared .
in this respect the power and duty of the president of the senate are , under the constitution , purely ministerial .
when , therefore , the joint resolution declares that no electoral votes shall be received or counted from states that since the 4th of march , 1867 , have not " adopted a constitution of state government under which a state government shall have organized , " a power is assumed which is nowhere delegated to congress , unless upon the assumption that the state governments organized prior to the 4th of march , 1867 , were illegal and void .
the joint resolution , by implication at least , concedes that these states were states by virtue of their organization prior to the 4th of march , 1867 , but denies to them the right to vote in the election of president and vice - president of the united states .
it follows either that this assumption of power is wholly unauthorized by the constitution or that the states so excluded from voting were out of the union by reason of the rebellion , and have never been legitimately restored .
being fully satisfied that they were never out of the union , and that their relations thereto have been legally and constitutionally restored , i am forced to the conclusion that the joint resolution , which deprives them of the right to have their votes for president and vice - president received and counted , is in conflict with the constitution , and that congress has no more power to reject their votes than those of the states which have been uniformly loyal to the federal union .
it is worthy of remark that if the states whose inhabitants were recently in rebellion were legally and constitutionally organized and restored to their rights prior to the 4th of march , 1867 , as i am satisfied they were , the only legitimate authority under which the election for president and vice - president can be held therein must be derived from the governments instituted before that period .
it clearly follows that all the state governments organized in those states under act of congress for that purpose , and under military control , are illegitimate and of no validity whatever ; and in that view the votes cast in those states for president and vice - president , in pursuance of acts passed since the 4th of march , 1867 , and in obedience to the so - called reconstruction acts of congress , can not be legally received and counted , while the only votes in those states that can be legally cast and counted will be those cast in pursuance of the laws in force in the several states prior to the legislation by congress upon the subject of reconstruction .
i can not refrain from directing your special attention to the declaration contained in the joint resolution , that " none of the states whose inhabitants were lately in rebellion shall be entitled to representation in the electoral college , " etc .
if it is meant by this declaration that no state is to be allowed to vote for president and vice - president all of whose inhabitants were engaged in the late rebellion , it is apparent that no one of the states will be excluded from voting , since it is well known that in every southern state there were many inhabitants who not only did not participate m the rebellion , but who actually took part in the suppression , or refrained from giving it any aid or countenance .
i therefore conclude that the true meaning of the joint resolution is that no state a portion of whose inhabitants were engaged in the rebellion shall be permitted to participate in the presidential election , except upon the terms and conditions therein prescribed .
assuming this to be the true construction of the resolution , the inquiry becomes pertinent , may those northern states a portion of whose inhabitants were actually in the rebellion be prevented , at the discretion of congress from having their electoral votes counted ?
it is well known that a portion of the inhabitants of new york and a portion of the inhabitants of virginia were alike engaged in the rebellion ; yet it is equally well known that virginia , as well as new york , was at all times during the war recognized by the federal government as a state in the union -- so clearly that upon the termination of hostilities it was not even deemed necessary for her restoration that a provisional governor should be appointed ; yet , according to this joint resolution , the people of virginia , unless they comply with the terms it prescribes , are denied the right of voting for president , while the people of new york , a portion of the inhabitants of which state were also in rebellion , are permitted to have their electoral votes counted without undergoing the process of reconstruction prescribed for virginia .
new york is no more a state than virginia ; the one is as much entitled to representation in the electoral college as the other .
if congress has the power to deprive virginia of this right , it can exercise the same authority with respect to new york or any other of the states .
thus the result of the presidential election may be controlled and determined by congress , and the people be deprived of their right under the constitution to choose a president and vice - president of the united states .
if congress were to provide by law that the votes of none of the states should be received and counted if cast for a candidate who differed in political sentiment with a majority of the two houses , such legislation would at once be condemned by the country as an unconstitutional and revolutionary usurpation of power .
it would , however , be exceedingly difficult to find in the constitution any more authority for the passage of the joint resolution under consideration than for an enactment looking directly to the rejection of all votes not in accordance with the political preferences of a majority of congress .
no power exists in the constitution authorizing the joint resolution or the supposed law -- the only difference being that one would be more palpably unconstitutional and revolutionary than the other .
both would rest upon the radical error that congress has the power to prescribe terms and conditions to the right of the people of the states to cast their votes for president and vice - president .
for the reasons thus indicated i am constrained to return the joint resolution to the senate for such further action thereon as congress may deem necessary .

fellow - citizens of the senate and house of representatives : 
 after a brief interval the congress of the united states resumes its annual legislative labors .
an all - wise and merciful providence has abated the pestilence which visited our shores , leaving its calamitous traces upon some portions of our country .
peace , order , tranquillity , and civil authority have been formally declared to exist throughout the whole of the united states .
in all of the states civil authority has superseded the coercion of arms , and the people , by their voluntary action , are maintaining their governments in full activity and complete operation .
the enforcement of the laws is no longer " obstructed in any state by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings , " and the animosities engendered by the war are rapidly yielding to the beneficent influences of our free institutions and to the kindly effects of unrestricted social and commercial intercourse .
an entire restoration of fraternal feeling must be the earnest wish of every patriotic heart ; and we will have accomplished our grandest national achievement when , forgetting the sad events of the past and remembering only their instructive lessons , we resume our onward career as a free , prosperous , and united people .
in my message of the 4th of december , 1865 , congress was informed of the measures which had been instituted by the executive with a view to the gradual restoration of the states in which the insurrection occurred to their relations with the general government .
provisional governors had been appointed , conventions called , governors elected , legislatures assembled , and senators and representatives chosen to the congress of the united states .
courts had been opened for the enforcement of laws long in abeyance .
the blockade had been removed , custom - houses reestablished , and the internal - revenue laws put in force , in order that the people might contribute to the national income .
postal operations had been renewed , and efforts were being made to restore them to their former condition of efficiency .
the states themselves had been asked to take dart in the high function of amending the constitution , and of thus sanctioning the extinction of african slavery as one of the legitimate results of our internecine struggle .
having progressed thus far , the executive department found that it had accomplished nearly all that was within the scope of its constitutional authority .
one thing , however , yet remained to be done before the work of restoration could be completed , and that was the admission to congress of loyal senators and representatives from the states whose people had rebelled against the lawful authority of the general government .
this question devolved upon the respective houses , which by the constitution are made the judges of the elections , returns , and qualifications of their own members , and its consideration at once engaged the attention of congress .
in the meantime the executive department -- no other plan having been proposed by congress -- continued its efforts to perfect , as far as was practicable , the restoration of the proper relations between the citizens of the respective states , the states , and the federal government , extending from time to time , as the public interests seemed to require , the judicial , revenue , and postal systems of the country .
with the advice and consent of the senate , the necessary officers were appointed and appropriations made by congress for the payment of their salaries .
the proposition to amend the federal constitution , so as to prevent the existence of slavery within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction , was ratified by the requisite number of states , and on the 18th day of december , 1865 , it was officially declared to have become valid as a part of the constitution of the united states .
all of the states in which the insurrection had existed promptly amended their constitutions so as to make them conform to the great change thus effected in the organic law of the land ; declared null and void all ordinances and laws of secession ; repudiated all pretended debts and obligations created for the revolutionary purposes of the insurrection , and proceeded in good faith to the enactment of measures for the protection and amelioration of the condition of the colored race .
congress , however , yet hesitated to admit any of these states to representation , and it was not until toward the close of the eighth month of the session that an exception was made in favor of tennessee by the admission of her senators and representatives .
i deem it a subject of profound regret that congress has thus far failed to admit to seats loyal senators and representatives from the other states whose inhabitants , with those of tennessee , had engaged in the rebellion .
ten states -- more than one - fourth of the whole number -- remain without representation ; the seats of fifty members in the house of representatives and of twenty members in the senate are yet vacant , not by their own consent , not by a failure of election , but by the refusal of congress to accept their credentials .
their admission , it is believed , would have accomplished much toward the renewal and strengthening of our relations as one people and removed serious cause for discontent on the part of the inhabitants of those states .
it would have accorded with the great principle enunciated in the declaration of american independence that no people ought to bear the burden of taxation and yet be denied the right of representation .
it would have been in consonance with the express provisions of the constitution that " each state shall have at least one representative " and " that no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate . "
these provisions were intended to secure to every state and to the people of every state the right of representation in each house of congress ; and so important was it deemed by the framers of the constitution that the equality of the states in the senate should be preserved that not even by an amendment of the constitution can any state , without its consent , be denied a voice in that branch of the national legislature .
it is true it has been assumed that the existence of the states was terminated by the rebellious acts of their inhabitants , and that , the insurrection having been suppressed , they were thenceforward to be considered merely as conquered territories .
the legislative , executive , and judicial departments of the government have , however , with heat distinctness and uniform consistency , refused to sanction an assumption so incompatible with the nature of our republican system and with the professed objects of the war .
throughout the recent legislation of congress the undeniable fact makes itself apparent that these ten political communities are nothing less than states of this union .
at the very commencement of the rebellion each house declared , with a unanimity as remarkable as it was significant , that the war was not " waged upon our part in any spirit of oppression , nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation , nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those states , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof , and to preserve the union , with all the dignity , equality , and rights of the several states unimpaired ; and that as soon as these objects " were " accomplished the war ought to cease . "
in some instances senators were permitted to continue their legislative functions , while in other instances representatives were elected and admitted to seats after their states had formally declared their right to withdraw from the union and were endeavoring to maintain that right by force of arms .
all of the states whose people were in insurrection , as states , were included in the apportionment of the direct tax of $ 20,000,000 annually laid upon the united states by the act approved 5th august , 1861 .
congress , by the act of march 4 , 1862 , and by the apportionment of representation thereunder also recognized their presence as states in the union ; and they have , for judicial purposes , been divided into districts , as states alone can be divided .
the same recognition appears in the recent legislation in reference to tennessee , which evidently rests upon the fact that the functions of the state were not destroyed by the rebellion , but merely suspended ; and that principle is of course applicable to those states which , like tennessee , attempted to renounce their places in the union .
the action of the executive department of the government upon this subject has been equally definite and uniform , and the purpose of the war was specifically stated in the proclamation issued by my predecessor on the 22d day of september , 1862 .
it was then solemnly proclaimed and declared " that hereafter , as heretofore , the war will be prosecuted for the object of practically restoring the constitutional relation between the united states and each of the states and the people thereof in which states that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed . "
the recognition of the states by the judicial department of the government has also been dear and conclusive in all proceedings affecting them as states had in the supreme , circuit , and district courts .
in the admission of senators and representatives from any and all of the states there can be no just ground of apprehension that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation , for this could not happen when the constitution and the laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful congress .
each house is made the " judge of the elections , returns , and qualifications of its own members , " and may , " with the concurrence of two - thirds , expel a member . "
when a senator or representative presents his certificate of election , he may at once be admitted or rejected ; or , should there be any question as to his eligibility , his credentials may be referred for investigation to the appropriate committee .
if admitted to a seat , it must be upon evidence satisfactory to the house of which he thus becomes a member that he possesses the requisite constitutional and legal qualifications .
if refused admission as a member for want of due allegiance to the government and returned to his constituents , they are admonished that none but persons loyal to the united states will be allowed a voice in the legislative councils of the nation , and the political power and moral influence of congress are thus effectively exerted in the interests of loyalty to the government and fidelity to the union .
upon this question , so vitally affecting the restoration of the union and the permanency of our present form of government , my convictions , heretofore expressed , have undergone no change , but , on the contrary , their correctness has been confirmed by reflection and time .
if the admission of loyal members to seats in the respective houses of congress was wise and expedient a year ago , it is no less wise and expedient now .
if this anomalous condition is right now -- if in the exact condition of these states at the present time it is lawful to exclude them from representation -- i do not see that the question will be changed by the efflux of time .
ten years hence .
if these states remain as they are , the right of representation will be no stronger , the right of exclusion will be no weaker .
the constitution of the united states makes it the duty of the president to recommend to the consideration of congress " such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . "
i know of no measure more imperatively demanded by every consideration of national interest , sound policy , and equal justice than the admission of loyal members from the now unrepresented states .
this would consummate the work of restoration and exert a most salutary influence in the reestablishment of peace , harmony , and fraternal feeling .
it would tend greatly to renew the confidence of the american people in the vigor and stability of their institutions .
it would bind us more closely together as a nation and enable us to show to the world the inherent and recuperative power of a government founded upon the will of the people and established upon the principles of liberty , justice , and intelligence .
our increased strength and enhanced prosperity would irrefragably demonstrate the fallacy of the arguments against free institutions drawn from our recent national disorders by the enemies of republican government .
the admission of loyal members from the states now excluded from congress , by allaying doubt and apprehension , would turn capital now awaiting an opportunity for investment into the channels of trade and industry .
it would alleviate the present troubled condition of those states , and by inducing emigration aid in the settlement of fertile regions now uncultivated and lead to an increased production of those staples which have added so greatly to the wealth of the nation and commerce of the world .
new fields of enterprise would be opened to our progressive people and soon the devastations of war would be repaired and all traces of our domestic differences effaced from the minds of our countrymen .
in our efforts to preserve " the unity of government which constitutes as one people " by restoring the states to the condition which they held prior to the rebellion , we should be cautious , lest , having rescued our nation from perils of threatened disintegration , we resort to consolidation , and in the end absolute despotism , as a remedy for the recurrence of similar troubles .
the war having terminated , and with it all occasion for the exercise of powers of doubtful constitutionality , we should hasten to bring legislation within the boundaries prescribed by the constitution and to return to the ancient landmarks established by our fathers for the guidance of succeeding generations .
the constitution which at any time exists till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all .
if in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong , let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designates ; but let there be no change by usurpation , for it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed .
washington spoke these words to his countrymen when , followed by their love and gratitude , he voluntarily retired from the cares of public life . "
to keep in all things within the pale of our constitutional powers and cherish the federal union as the only rock of safety " were prescribed by jefferson as rules of action to endear to his " countrymen the true principles of their constitution and promote a union of sentiment and action , equally auspicious to their happiness and safety . "
jackson held that the action of the general government should always be strictly confined to the sphere of its appropriate duties , and justly and forcibly urged that our government is not to be maintained nor our union preserved " by invasions of the rights and powers of the several states .
in thus attempting to make our general government strong we make it weak .
its true strength consists in leaving individuals and states as much as possible to themselves ; in making itself felt , not in its power , but in its beneficence ; not in its control , but in its protection ; not in binding the states more closely to the center , but leaving each to move unobstructed in its proper constitutional orbit . "
these are the teachings of men whose deeds and services have made them illustrious , and who , long since withdrawn from the scenes of life , have left to their country the rich legacy of their example , their wisdom , and their patriotism .
drawing fresh inspiration from their lessons , let us emulate them in love of country and respect for the constitution and the laws .
the report of the secretary of the treasury affords much information respecting the revenue and commerce of the country .
his views upon the currency and with reference to a proper adjustment of our revenue system , internal as well as impost , are commended to the careful consideration of congress .
in my last annual message i expressed my general views upon these subjects .
i need now only call attention to the necessity of carrying into every department of the government a system of rigid accountability , thorough retrenchment , and wise economy .
with no exceptional nor unusual expenditures , the oppressive burdens of taxation can be lessened by such a modification of our revenue laws as will be consistent with the public faith and the legitimate and necessary wants of the government .
the report presents a much more satisfactory condition of our finances than one year ago the most sanguine could have anticipated .
during the fiscal year ending the 30th june , 1865 ( the last year of the war ) , the public debt was increased $ 941,902,537 , and on the 31st of october , 1865 , it amounted to $ 2,740,854,750 .
on the 31st day of october , 1866 , it had been reduced to $ 2,552,310,006 , the diminution during a period of fourteen months , commencing september 1 , 1865 , and ending october 31 , 1866 , having been $ 206,379,565 .
in the last annual report on the state of the finances it was estimated that during the three quarters of the fiscal year ending the 30th of june last the debt would be increased $ 112,194,947 .
during that period , however , it was reduced $ 31,196,387 , the receipts of the year having been $ 89,905,905 more and the expenditures $ 200,529,235 less than the estimates .
nothing could more clearly indicate than these statements the extent and availability of the national resources and the rapidity and safety with which under our form of government , great military and naval establishments can be disbanded and expenses reduced from a war to a peace footing .
during the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1866 , the receipts were $ 558,032,620 and the expenditures $ 520,750,940 , leaving an available surplus of $ 37,281,680 .
it is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal year ending the 30th june , 1867 , will be $ 475,061.386 , and that the expenditures will reach the sum of $ 316,428,078 , leaving in the treasury a surplus of $ 158,633,308 .
for the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1886 , it is estimated that the receipts will amount to $ 436,000,000 and that the expenditures will be $ 350,247,641 , showing an excess of $ 85,752,359 in favor of the government .
these estimated receipts may be diminished by a reduction of excise and import duties , but after all necessary reductions shall have been made the revenue of the present and of following years will doubtless be sufficient to cover all legitimate charges upon the treasury and leave a large annual surplus to be applied to the payment of the principal of the debt .
there seems now to be no good reason why taxes may not be reduced as the country advances in population and wealth , and yet the debt be extinguished within the next quarter of a century .
the report of the secretary of war furnishes valuable and important information in reference to the operations of his department during the past year .
few volunteers now remain in the service , and they are being discharged as rapidly as they can be replaced by regular troops .
the army has been promptly paid , carefully provided with medical treatment , well sheltered and subsisted , and is to be furnished with breech - loading small arms .
the military strength of the nation has been unimpaired by the discharge of volunteers , the disposition of unserviceable or perishable stores , and the retrenchment of expenditure .
sufficient war material to meet any emergency has been retained , and from the disbanded volunteers standing ready to respond to the national call large armies can be rapidly organized , equipped , and concentrated .
fortifications on the coast and frontier have received or are being prepared for more powerful armaments ; lake surveys and harbor and river improvements are in course of energetic prosecution .
preparations have been made for the payment of the additional bounties authorized during the recent session of congress , under such regulations as will protect the government from fraud and secure to the honorably discharged soldier the well - earned reward of his faithfulness and gallantry .
more than 6,000 maimed soldiers have received artificial limbs or other surgical apparatus and 41 national cemeteries , containing the remains of 104,526 union soldiers , have already been established .
the total estimate of military appropriations is $ 25,205,669 .
it is stated in the report of the secretary of the navy that the naval force at this time consists of 278 vessels , armed with 2,351 guns .
of these , 115 vessels , carrying 1,029 guns , are in commission , distributed chiefly among seven squadrons .
the number of men in the service is 13,600 .
great activity and vigilance have been displayed by all the squadrons , and their movements have been judiciously and efficiently arranged in such manner as would best promote american commerce and protect the rights and interests of our countrymen abroad .
the vessels unemployed are undergoing repairs or are laid up until their services may be required .
most of the ironclad fleet is at league island , in the vicinity of philadelphia , a place which , until decisive action should be taken by congress , was selected by the secretary of the navy as the most eligible location for that class of vessels .
it is important that a suitable public station should be provided for the ironclad fleet .
it is intended that these vessels shall be in proper condition for any emergency , and it is desirable that the bill accepting league island for naval purposes , which passed the house of representatives at its last session , should receive final action at an early period , in order that there may be a suitable public station for this class of vessels , as well as a navy - yard of area sufficient for the wants of the service on the delaware river .
the naval pension fund amounts to $ 11,750,000 , having been increased $ 2,750,000 during the year .
the expenditures of the department for the fiscal year ending 30th june last were $ 43,324,526 , and the estimates for the coming year amount to $ 23,568,436 .
attention is invited to the condition of our seamen and the importance of legislative measures for their relief and improvement .
the suggestions in behalf of this deserving class of our fellow - citizens are earnestly recommended to the favorable attention of congress .
the report of the postmaster - general presents a most satisfactory condition of the postal service and submits recommendations which deserve the consideration of congress .
the revenues of the department for the year ending june 30 , 1866 , were $ 14,386,986 and the expenditures $ 15,352,079 , showing an excess of the latter of $ 965,093 .
in anticipation of this deficiency , however , a special appropriation was made by congress in the act approved july 28 , 1866 .
including the standing appropriation of $ 700,000 for free mail matter as a legitimate portion of the revenues , yet remaining unexpended , the actual deficiency for the past year is only $ 265,093 - -a sum within $ 51,141 of the amount estimated in the annual report of 1864 .
the decrease of revenue compared with the previous year was 1 1/5 per cent , and the increase of expenditures , owing principally to the enlargement of the mail service in the south , was 12 per cent .
on the 30th of june last there were in operation 6,930 mail routes , with an aggregate length of 180,921 miles , an aggregate annual transportation of 71,837,914 miles , and an aggregate annual cost , including all expenditures , of $ 8,410,184 .
the length of railroad routes is 32,092 miles and the annual transportation 30,609,467 miles .
the length of steamboat routes is 14,346 miles and the annual transportation 3,411,962 miles .
the mail service is rapidly increasing throughout the whole country , and its steady extension in the southern states indicates their constantly improving condition .
the growing importance of the foreign service also merits attention .
the post - office department of great britain and our own have agreed upon a preliminary basis for a new postal convention , which it is believed will prove eminently beneficial to the commercial interests of the united states , inasmuch as it contemplates a reduction of the international letter postage to one - half the existing rates : a reduction of postage with all other countries to and from which correspondence is transmitted in the british mail , or in closed mails through the united kingdom ; the establishment of uniform and reasonable charges for the sea and territorial transit of correspondence in closed mails ; and an allowance to each post - office department of the right to use all mail communications established under the authority of the other for the dispatch of correspondence , either in open or closed mails , on the same terms as those applicable to the inhabitants of the country providing the means of transmission .
the report of the secretary of the interior exhibits the condition of those branches of the public service which are committed to his supervision .
during the last fiscal year 4,629,312 acres of public land were disposed of , 1,892,516 acres of which were entered under the homestead act .
the policy originally adopted relative to the public lands has undergone essential modifications .
immediate revenue , and not their rapid settlement , was the cardinal feature of our land system .
long experience and earnest discussion have resulted in the conviction that the early development of our agricultural resources and the diffusion of an energetic population over our vast territory are objects of far greater importance to the national growth and prosperity than the proceeds of the sale of the land to the highest bidder in open market .
the preemption laws confer upon the pioneer who complies with the terms they impose the privilege of purchasing a limited portion of " unoffered lands " at the minimum price .
the homestead enactments relieve the settler from the payment of purchase money , and secure him a permanent home upon the condition of residence for a term of years .
this liberal policy invites emigration from the old and from the more crowded portions of the new world .
its propitious results are undoubted , and will be more signally manifested when time shall have given to it a wider development .
congress has made liberal grants of public land to corporations in aid of the construction of railroads and other internal improvements .
should this policy hereafter prevail , more stringent provisions will be required to secure a faithful application of the fund .
the title to the lands should not pass , by patent or otherwise , but remain in the government and subject to its control until some portion of the road has been actually built .
portions of them might then from time to time be conveyed to the corporation , but never in a greater ratio to the whole quantity embraced by the grant than the completed parts bear to the entire length of the projected improvement .
this restriction would not operate to the prejudice of any undertaking conceived in good faith and executed with reasonable energy , as it is the settled practice to withdraw from market the lands falling within the operation of such grants , and thus to exclude the inception of a subsequent adverse right .
a breach of the conditions which congress may deem proper to impose should work a forfeiture of claim to the lands so withdrawn but unconveyed , and of title to the lands conveyed which remain unsold .
operations on the several lines of the pacific railroad have been prosecuted with unexampled vigor and success .
should no unforeseen causes of delay occur , it is confidently anticipated that this great thoroughfare will be completed before the expiration of the period designated by congress .
during the last fiscal year the amount paid to pensioners , including the expenses of disbursement , was $ 13,459,996 , and 50,177 names were added to the pension rolls .
the entire number of pensioners june 30 , 1866 , was 126,722 .
this fact furnishes melancholy and striking proof of the sacrifices made to vindicate the constitutional authority of the federal government and to maintain inviolate the integrity of the union they impose upon us corresponding obligations .
it is estimated that $ 33,000,000 will be required to meet the exigencies of this branch of the service during the next fiscal year .
treaties have been concluded with the indians , who , enticed into armed opposition to our government at the outbreak of the rebellion , have unconditionally submitted to our authority and manifested an earnest desire for a renewal of friendly relations .
during the year ending september 30 , 1866 , 8,716 patents for useful inventions and designs were issued , and at that date the balance in the treasury to the credit of the patent fund was $ 228,297 .
as a subject upon which depends an immense amount of the production and commerce of the country , i recommend to congress such legislation as may be necessary for the preservation of the levees of the mississippi river .
it is a matter of national importance that early steps should be taken , not only to add to the efficiency of these barriers against destructive inundations , but for the removal of all obstructions to the free and safe navigation of that great channel of trade and commerce .
the district of columbia under existing laws is not entitled to that representation in the national councils which from our earliest history has been uniformly accorded to each territory established from time to time within our limits .
it maintains peculiar relations to congress , to whom the constitution has granted the power of exercising exclusive legislation over the seat of government .
our fellow - citizens residing in the district , whose interests are thus confided to the special guardianship of congress , exceed in number the population of several of our territories , and no just reason is perceived why a delegate of their choice should not be admitted to a seat in the house of representatives .
no mode seems so appropriate and effectual of enabling them to make known their peculiar condition and wants and of securing the local legislation adapted to them .
i therefore recommend the passage of a law authorizing the electors of the district of columbia to choose a delegate , to be allowed the same rights and privileges as a delegate representing a territory .
the increasing enterprise and rapid progress of improvement in the district are highly gratifying , and i trust that the efforts of the municipal authorities to promote the prosperity of the national metropolis will receive the efficient and generous cooperation of congress .
the report of the commissioner of agriculture reviews the operations of his department during the past year , and asks the aid of congress in its efforts to encourage those states which , scourged by war , are now earnestly engaged in the reorganization of domestic industry .
it is a subject of congratulation that no foreign combinations against our domestic peace and safety or our legitimate influence among the nations have been formed or attempted .
while sentiments of reconciliation , loyalty , and patriotism have increased at home , a more just consideration of our national character and rights has been manifested by foreign nations .
the entire success of the atlantic telegraph between the coast of ireland and the province of newfoundland is an achievement which has been justly celebrated in both hemispheres as the opening of an era in the progress of civilization .
there is reason to expect that equal success will attend and even greater results follow the enterprise for connecting the two continents through the pacific ocean by the projected line of telegraph between kamchatka and the russian possessions in america .
the resolution of congress protesting against pardons by foreign governments of persons convicted of infamous offenses on condition of emigration to our country has been communicated to the states with which we maintain intercourse , and the practice , so justly the subject of complaint on our part , has not been renewed .
the congratulations of congress to the emperor of russia upon his escape from attempted assassination have been presented to that humane and enlightened ruler and received by him with expressions of grateful appreciation .
the executive , warned of an attempt by spanish american adventurers to induce the emigration of freedmen of the united states to a foreign country , protested against the project as one which , if consummated , would reduce them to a bondage even more oppressive than that from which they have just been relieved .
assurance has been received from the government of the state in which the plan was matured that the proceeding will meet neither its encouragement nor approval .
it is a question worthy of your consideration whether our laws upon this subject are adequate to the prevention or punishment of the crime thus meditated .
in the month of april last , as congress is aware , a friendly arrangement was made between the emperor of france and the president of the united states for the withdrawal from mexico of the french expeditionary military forces .
this withdrawal was to be effected in three detachments , the first of which , it was understood , would leave mexico in november , now past , the second in march next , and the third and last in november , 1867 .
immediately upon the completion of the evacuation the french government was to assume the same attitude of nonintervention in regard to mexico as is held by the government of the united states .
repeated assurances have been given by the emperor since that agreement that he would complete the promised evacuation within the period mentioned , or sooner .
it was reasonably expected that the proceedings thus contemplated would produce a crisis of great political interest in the republic of mexico .
the newly appointed minister of the united states , mr. campbell , was therefore sent forward on the 9th day of november last to assume his proper functions as minister plenipotentiary of the united states to that republic .
it was also thought expedient that he should be attended in the vicinity of mexico by the lieutenant - general of the army of the united states , with the view of obtaining such information as might be important to determine the course to be pursued by the united states in reestablishing and maintaining necessary and proper intercourse with the republic of mexico .
deeply interested in the cause of liberty and humanity , it seemed an obvious duty on our part to exercise whatever influence we possessed for the restoration and permanent establishment in that country of a domestic and republican form of government .
such was the condition of our affairs in regard to mexico when , on the 22d of november last , official information was received from paris that the emperor of france had some time before decided not to withdraw a detachment of his forces in the month of november past , according to engagement , but that this decision was made with the purpose of withdrawing the whole of those forces in the ensuing spring .
of this determination , however , the united states had not received any notice or intimation , and so soon as the information was received by the government care was taken to make known its dissent to the emperor of france .
i can not forego the hope that france will reconsider the subject and adopt some resolution in regard to the evacuation of mexico which will conform as nearly as practicable with the existing engagement , and thus meet the just expectations of the united states .
the papers relating to the subject will be laid before you .
it is believed that with the evacuation of mexico by the expeditionary forces no subject for serious differences between france and the united states would remain .
the expressions of the emperor and people of france warrant a hope that the traditionary friendship between the two countries might in that case be renewed and permanently restored .
a claim of a citizen of the united states for indemnity for spoliations committed on the high seas by the french authorities in the exercise of a belligerent power against mexico has been met by the government of france with a proposition to defer settlement until a mutual convention for the adjustment of all claims of citizens and subjects of both countries arising out of the recent wars on this continent shall be agreed upon by the two countries .
the suggestion is not deemed unreasonable .
but it belongs to congress to direct the manner in which claims for indemnity by foreigners as well as by citizens of the united states arising out of the late civil war shall be adjudicated and determined .
i have no doubt that the subject of all such claims will engage your attention at a convenient and proper time .
it is a matter of regret that no considerable advance has been made toward an adjustment of the differences between the united states and great britain arising out of the depredations upon our national commerce and other trespasses committed during our civil war by british subjects , in violation of international law and treaty obligations .
the delay , however , may be believed to have resulted in no small degree from the domestic situation of great britain .
an entire change of ministry occurred in that country during the last session of parliament .
the attention of the new ministry was called to the subject at an early day , and there is some reason to expect that it will now be considered in a becoming and friendly spirit .
the importance of an early disposition of the question can not be exaggerated .
whatever might be the wishes of the two governments , it is manifest that good will and friendship between the two countries can not be established until a reciprocity in the practice of good faith and neutrality shall be restored between the respective nations .
on the 6th of june last , in violation of our neutrality laws , a military expedition and enterprise against the british north american colonies was projected and attempted to be carried on within the territory and jurisdiction of the united states .
in obedience to the obligation imposed upon the executive by the constitution to see that the laws are faithfully executed , all citizens were warned by proclamation against taking part in or aiding such unlawful proceedings , and the proper civil , military , and naval officers were directed to take all necessary measures for the enforcement of the laws .
the expedition failed , but it has not been without its painful consequences .
some of our citizens who , it was alleged , were engaged in the expedition were captured , and have been brought to trial as for a capital offense in the province of canada .
judgment and sentence of death have been pronounced against some , while others have been acquitted .
fully believing in the maxim of government that severity of civil punishment for misguided persons who have engaged in revolutionary attempts which have disastrously failed is unsound and unwise , such representations have been made to the british government in behalf of the convicted persons as , being sustained by an enlightened and humane judgment , will , it is hoped , induce in their cases an exercise of clemency and a judicious amnesty to all who were engaged in the movement .
counsel has been employed by the government to defend citizens of the united states on trial for capital offenses in canada , and a discontinuance of the prosecutions which were instituted in the courts of the united states against those who took part in the expedition has been directed .
i have regarded the expedition as not only political in its nature , but as also in a great measure foreign from the united states in its causes , character , and objects .
the attempt was understood to be made in sympathy with an insurgent party in ireland , and by striking at a british province on this continent was designed to aid in obtaining redress for political grievances which , it was assumed , the people of ireland had suffered at the hands of the british government during a period of several centuries .
the persons engaged in it were chiefly natives of that country , some of whom had , while others had not , become citizens of the united states under our general laws of naturalization .
complaints of misgovernment in ireland continually engage the attention of the british nation , and so great an agitation is now prevailing in ireland that the british government have deemed it necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in that country .
these circumstances must necessarily modify the opinion which we might otherwise have entertained in regard to an expedition expressly prohibited by our neutrality laws .
so long as those laws remain upon our statute books they should be faithfully executed , and if they operate harshly , unjustly , or oppressively congress alone can apply the remedy by their modification or repeal .
political and commercial interests of the united states are not unlikely to be affected in some degree by events which are transpiring in the eastern regions of europe , and the time seems to have come when our government ought to have a proper diplomatic representation in greece .
this government has claimed for all persons not convicted or accused or suspected of crime an absolute political right of self - expatriation and a choice of new national allegiance .
most of the european states have dissented from this principle , and have claimed a right to hold such of their subjects as have emigrated to and been naturalized in the united states and afterwards returned on transient visits to their native countries to the performance of military service in like manner as resident subjects .
complaints arising from the claim in this respect made by foreign states have heretofore been matters of controversy between the united states and some of the european powers , and the irritation consequent upon the failure to settle this question increased during the war in which prussia , italy , and austria were recently engaged .
while great britain has never acknowledged the right of expatriation , she has not for some years past practically insisted upon the opposite doctrine .
france has been equally forbearing , and prussia has proposed a compromise , which , although evincing increased liberality , has not been accepted by the united states .
peace is now prevailing everywhere in europe , and the present seems to be a favorable time for an assertion by congress of the principle so long maintained by the executive department that naturalization by one state fully exempts the native - born subject of any other state from the performance of military service under any foreign government , so long as he does not voluntarily renounce its rights and benefits .
in the performance of a duty imposed upon me by the constitution i have thus submitted to the representatives of the states and of the people such information of our domestic and foreign affairs as the public interests seem to require .
our government is now undergoing its most trying ordeal , and my earnest prayer is that the peril may be successfully and finally passed without impairing its original strength and symmetry .
the interests of the nation are best to be promoted by the revival of fraternal relations , the complete obliteration of our past differences , and the reinauguration of all the pursuits of peace .
directing our efforts to the early accomplishment of these great ends , let us endeavor to preserve harmony between the coordinate departments of the government , that each in its proper sphere may cordially cooperate with the other in securing the maintenance of the constitution , the preservation of the union , and the perpetuity of our free institutions .

to the senate of the united states : 
 i regret that the bill , which has passed both houses of congress , entitled " an act to protect all persons in the united states in their civil rights and furnish the means of their vindication , " contains provisions which i can not approve consistently with my sense of duty to the whole people and my obligations to the constitution of the united states .
i am therefore constrained to return it to the senate , the house in which it originated , with my objections to its becoming a law .
by the first section of the bill all persons born in the united states and not subject to any foreign power , excluding indians not taxed , are declared to be citizens of the united states .
this provision comprehends the chinese of the pacific states , indians subject to taxation , the people called gypsies , as well as the entire race designated as blacks , people of color .
negroes , mulattoes , and persons of african blood .
every individual of these races born in the united states is by the bill made a citizen of the united states .
it does not purport to declare or confer any other right of citizenship than federal citizenship .
it does not purport to give these classes of persons any status as citizens of states , except that which may result from their status as citizens of the united states .
the power to confer the right of state citizenship is just as exclusively with the several states as the power to confer the right of federal citizenship is with congress .
the right of federal citizenship thus to be conferred on the several excepted races before mentioned is now for the first time proposed to be given by law .
if , as is claimed by many , all persons who are native born already are , by virtue of the constitution , citizens of the united states , the passage of the pending bill can not be necessary to make them such .
if , on the other hand , such persons are not citizens , as may be assumed from the proposed legislation to make them such , the grave question presents itself whether , when eleven of the thirty - six states are unrepresented in congress at the present time , it is sound policy to make our entire colored population and all other excepted classes citizens of the united states .
four millions of them have just emerged from slavery into freedom .
can it be reasonably supposed that they possess the requisite qualifications to entitle them to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the united states ?
have the people of the several states expressed such a conviction ?
it may also be asked whether it is necessary that they should be declared citizens in order that they may be secured in the enjoyment of the civil rights proposed to be conferred by the bill .
those rights are , by federal as well as state laws , secured to all domiciled aliens and foreigners , even before the completion of the process of naturalization ; and it may safely be assumed that the same enactments are sufficient to give like protection and benefits to those for whom this bill provides special legislation .
besides , the policy of the government from its origin to the present time seems to have been that persons who are strangers to and unfamiliar with our institutions and our laws should pass through a certain probation , at the end of which , before attaining the coveted prize , they must give evidence of their fitness to receive and to exercise the rights of citizens as contemplated by the constitution of the united states .
the bill in effect proposes a discrimination against large numbers of intelligent , worthy , and patriotic foreigners , and in favor of the negro , to whom , after long years of bondage , the avenues to freedom and intelligence have just now been suddenly opened .
he must of necessity , from his previous unfortunate condition of servitude , be less informed as to the nature and character of our institutions than he who , coming from abroad , has , to some extent at least , familiarized himself with the principles of a government to which he voluntarily intrusts " life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . "
yet it is now proposed , by a single legislative enactment , to confer the rights of citizens upon all persons of african descent born within the extended limits of the united states , while persons of foreign birth who make our land their home must undergo a probation of five years , and can only then become citizens upon proof that they are " of good moral character , attached to the principles of the constitution of the united states , and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same . "
the first section of the bill also contains an enumeration of the rights to be enjoyed by these classes so made citizens " in every state and territory in the united states . "
these rights are " to make and enforce contracts ; to sue , be parties , and give evidence : to inherit , purchase , lease , sell , hold , and convey real and personal property , " and to have " full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens . "
so , too , they are made subject to the same punishment , pains , and penalties in common with white citizens , and to none other .
thus a perfect equality of the white and colored races is attempted to be fixed by federal law in every state of the union over the vast field of state jurisdiction covered by these enumerated rights .
in no one of these can any state ever exercise any power of discrimination between the different races .
in the exercise of state policy over matters exclusively affecting the people of each state it has frequently been thought expedient to discriminate between the two races .
by the statutes of some of the states , northern as well as southern , it is enacted , for instance , that no white person shall intermarry with a negro or mulatto .
chancellor kent says , speaking of the blacks , 
 marriages between them and the whites are forbidden in some of the states where slavery does not exist , and they are prohibited in all the slaveholding states ; and when not absolutely contrary to law , they are revolting , and regarded as an offense against public decorum .
i do not say that this bill repeals state laws on the subject of marriage between the two races , for as the whites are forbidden to intermarry with the blacks , the blacks can only make such contracts as the whites themselves are allowed to make , and therefore can not under this bill enter into the marriage contract with the whites .
i cite this discrimination , however , as an instance of the state policy as to discrimination , and to inquire whether if congress can abrogate all state laws of discrimination between the two races in the matter of real estate , of suits , and of contracts generally congress may not also repeal the state laws as to the contract of marriage between the two races .
hitherto every subject embraced in the enumeration of rights contained in this bill has been considered as exclusively belonging to the states .
they all relate to the internal police and economy of the respective states .
they are matters which in each state concern the domestic condition of its people , varying in each according to its own peculiar circumstances and the safety and well - being of its own citizens .
i do not mean to say that upon all these subjects there are not federal restraints -- as , for instance , in the state power of legislation over contracts there is a federal limitation that no state shall pass a law impairing the obligations of contracts : and , as to crimes , that no state shall pass an ex post facto law ; and , as to money , that no state shall make anything but gold and silver a legal tender ; but where can we find a federal prohibition against the power of any state to discriminate , as do most of them , between aliens and citizens , between artificial persons , called corporations , and natural persons , in the right to hold real estate ?
if it be granted that congress can repeal all state laws discriminating between whites and blacks in the subjects covered by this bill , why , it may be asked , may not congress repeal in the same way all state laws discriminating between the two races on the subjects of suffrage and office ?
if congress can declare by law who shall hold lands , who shall testify , who shall have capacity to make a contract in a state , then congress can by law also declare who , without regard to color or race , shall have the right to sit as a juror or as a judge , to hold any office , and , finally , to vote " in every state and territory of the united states . "
as respects the territories , they come within the power of congress , for as to them the lawmaking power is the federal power ; but as to the states no similar provision exists vesting in congress the power " to make rules and regulations " for them .
the object of the second section of the bill is to afford discriminating protection to colored persons in the full enjoyment of all the rights secured to them by the preceding section .
it declares-- 
 that any person who , under color of any law , statute , ordinance , regulation , or custom , shall subject , or cause to be subjected , any inhabitant of any state or territory to the deprivation of any right secured or protected by this act , or to different punishment , pains , or penalties on account of such person having at any time been held in a condition of slavery or involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , or by reason of his color or race , than is prescribed for the punishment of white persons , shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor .
and on conviction shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 1,000 , or imprisonment not exceeding one year , or both , in the discretion of the court .
this section seems to be designed to apply to some existing or future law of a state or territory which may conflict with the provisions of the bill now under consideration .
it provides for counteracting such forbidden legislation by imposing fine and imprisonment upon the legislators who may pass such conflicting laws , or upon the officers or agents who shall put or attempt to put them into execution .
it means an official offense , not a common crime committed against law upon the persons or property of the black race .
such an act may deprive the black man of his property , but not of the right to hold property .
it means a deprivation of the right itself , either by the state judiciary or the state legislature it is therefore assumed that under this section members of state legislatures who should vote for laws conflicting with the provisions of the bill , that judges of the state courts who should render judgments in antagonism with its terms , and that marshals and sheriffs who should , as ministerial officers , execute processes sanctioned by state laws and issued by state judges in execution of their judgments could be brought before other tribunals and there subjected to fine and imprisonment for the performance of the duties which such state laws might impose .
the legislation thus proposed invades the judicial power of the state .
it says to every state court or judge , if you decide that this act is unconstitutional ; if you refuse , under the prohibition of a state law , to allow a negro to testify ; if you hold that over such a subject - matter the state law is paramount , and " under color " of a state law refuse the exercise of the right to the negro , your error of judgment , however conscientious , shall subject you to fine and imprisonment .
i do not apprehend that the conflicting legislation which the bill seems to contemplate is so likely to occur as to render it necessary at this time to adopt a measure of such doubtful constitutionality .
in the next place , this provision of the bill seems to be unnecessary , as adequate judicial remedies could be adopted to secure the desired end without invading the immunities of legislators , always important to be preserved in the interest of public liberty ; without assailing the independence of the judiciary , always essential to the preservation of individual rights ; and without impairing the efficiency of ministerial officers , always necessary for the maintenance of public peace and order .
the remedy proposed by this section seems to be in this respect not only anomalous , but unconstitutional : for the constitution guarantees nothing with certainty if it does not insure to the several states the right of making and executing laws in regard to all matters arising within their jurisdiction , subject only to the restriction that in cases of conflict with the constitution and constitutional laws of the united states the latter should be held to be the supreme law of the land .
the third section gives the district courts of the united states exclusive " cognizance of all crimes and offenses committed against the provisions of this act , " and concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts of the united states of all civil and criminal cases " affecting persons who are denied or can not enforce in the courts or judicial tribunals of the state or locality where they may be any of the rights secured to them by the first section . "
the construction which i have given to the second section is strengthened by this third section , for it makes clear what kind of denial or deprivation of the rights secured by the first section was in contemplation .
it is a denial or deprivation of such rights " in the courts or judicial tribunals of the state . "
it stands , therefore , clear of doubt that the offense and the penalties provided in the second section are intended for the state judge who , in the clear exercise of his functions as a judge , not acting ministerially but judicially , shall decide contrary to this federal law .
in other words , when a state judge , acting upon a question involving a conflict between a state law and a federal law , and bound , according to his own judgment and responsibility , to give an impartial decision between the two , comes to the conclusion that the state law is valid and the federal law is invalid , he must not follow the dictates of his own judgment , at the peril of fine and imprisonment .
the legislative department of the government of the united states thus takes from the judicial department of the states the sacred and exclusive duty of judicial decision , and converts the state judge into a mere ministerial officer , bound to decide according to the will of congress .
it is clear that in states which deny to persons whose rights are secured by the first section of the bill any one of those rights all criminal and civil cases affecting them will , by the provisions of the third section , come under the exclusive cognizance of the federal tribunals .
it follows that if , in any state which denies to a colored person any one of all those rights , that person should commit a crime against the laws of a state -- murder , arson , rape , or any other crime -- all protection and punishment through the courts of the state are taken away , and he can only be tried and punished in the federal courts .
how is the criminal to be tried ?
if the offense is provided for and punished by federal law , that law , and not the state law , is to govern .
it is only when the offense does not happen to be within the purview of federal law that the federal courts are to try and punish him under any other law .
then resort is to be had to " the common law , as modified and changed " by state legislation , " so far as the same is not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the united states . "
so that over this vast domain of criminal jurisprudence provided by each state for the protection of its own citizens and for the punishment of all persons who violate its criminal laws , federal law , whenever it can be made to apply , displaces state law .
the question here naturally arises , from what source congress derives the power to transfer to federal tribunals certain classes of cases embraced in this section .
the constitution expressly declares that the judicial power of the united states " shall extend to all cases , in law and equity , arising under this constitution , the laws of the united states , and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority ; to all cases affecting ambassadors , other public ministers , and consuls ; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ; to controversies to which the united states shall be a party ; to controversies between two or more states , between a state and citizens of another state , between citizens of different states , between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states , and between a state , or the citizens thereof , and foreign states , citizens , or subjects . "
here the judicial power of the united states is expressly set forth and defined : and the act of september 24 .
1789 , establishing the judicial courts of the united states , in conferring upon the federal courts jurisdiction over cases originating in state tribunals , is careful to confine them to the classes enumerated in the above - recited clause of the constitution .
this section of the bill undoubtedly comprehends cases and authorizes the exercise of powers that are not , by the constitution , within the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states .
to transfer them to those courts would be an exercise of authority well calculated to excite distrust and alarm on the part of all the states , for the bill applies alike to all of them -- as well to those that have as to those that have not been engaged in rebellion .
it may be assumed that this authority is incident to the power granted to congress by the constitution , as recently amended , to enforce , by appropriate legislation , the article declaring that-- 
 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction .
it can not , however , be justly claimed that , with a view to the enforcement of this article of the constitution , there is at present any necessity for the exercise of all the powers which this bill confers .
slavery has been abolished , and at present nowhere exists within the jurisdiction of the united states ; nor has there been , nor is it likely there will be , any attempt to revive it by the people or the states .
if , however , any such attempt shall be made , it will then become the duty of the general government to exercise any and all incidental powers necessary and proper to maintain inviolate this great constitutional law of freedom .
the fourth section of the bill provides that officers and agents of the freedmen 's bureau shall be empowered to make arrests , and also that other officers may be specially commissioned for that purpose by the president of the united states .
it also authorizes circuit courts of the united states and the superior courts of the territories to appoint , without limitation , commissioners , who are to be charged with the performance of quasi judicial duties .
the fifth section empowers the commissioners so to be selected by the courts to appoint in writing , under their hands , one or more suitable persons from time to time to execute warrants and other processes described by the bill .
these numerous official agents are made to constitute a sort of police , in addition to the military , and are authorized to summon a posse comitatus , and even to call to their aid such portion of the land and naval forces of the united states , or of the militia , " as may be necessary to the performance of the duty with which they are charged . "
this extraordinary power is to be conferred upon agents irresponsible to the government and to the people , to whose number the discretion of the commissioners is the only limit , and in whose hands such authority might be made a terrible engine of wrong , oppression , and fraud .
the general statutes regulating the land and naval forces of the united states , the militia , and the execution of the laws are believed to be adequate for every emergency which can occur in time of peace .
if it should prove otherwise , congress can at any time amend those laws in such manner as , while subserving the public welfare , not to jeopard the rights , interests , and liberties of the people .
the seventh section provides that a fee of $ 10 shall be paid to each commissioner in every case brought before him , and a fee of $ 5 to his deputy or deputies " for each person he or they may arrest and take before any such commissioner , " " with such other fees as may be deemed reasonable by such commissioner , " " in general for performing such other duties as may be required in the premises . "
all these fees are to be " paid out of the treasury of the united states , " whether there is a conviction or not ; but in case of conviction they are to be recoverable from the defendant .
it seems to me that under the influence of such temptations bad men might convert any law , however beneficent , into an instrument of persecution and fraud .
by the eighth section of the bill the united states courts , which sit only in one place for white citizens , must migrate with the marshal and district attorney ( and necessarily with the clerk , although he is not mentioned ) to any part of the district upon the order of the president , and there hold a court , " for the purpose of the more speedy arrest and trial of persons charged with a violation of this act ; " and there the judge and officers of the court must remain , upon the order of the president , " for the time therein designated . "
the ninth section authorizes the president , or such person as he may empower for that purpose , " to employ such part of the land or naval forces of the united states , or of the militia , as shall be necessary to prevent the violation and enforce ' the due execution of this act . "
this language seems to imply a permanent military force , that is to be always at hand , and whose only business is to be the enforcement of this measure over the vast region where it is intended to operate .
i do not propose to consider the policy of this bill .
to me the details of the bill seem fraught with evil .
the white race and the black race of the south have hitherto lived together under the relation of master and slave capital owning labor .
now , suddenly , that relation is changed , and as to ownership capital and labor are divorced .
they stand now each master of itself .
in this new relation , one being necessary to the other , there will be a new adjustment , which both are deeply interested in making harmonious .
each has equal power in settling the terms , and if left to the laws that regulate capital and labor it is confidently believed that they will satisfactorily work out the problem .
capital , it is true , has more intelligence , but labor is never so ignorant as not to understand its own interests , not to know its own value , and not to see that capital must pay that value .
this bill frustrates this adjustment .
it intervenes between capital and labor and attempts to settle questions of political economy through the agency of numerous officials whose interest it will be to foment discord between the two races , for as the breach widens their employment will continue , and when it is closed their occupation will terminate .
in all our history , in all our experience as a people living under federal and state law , no such system as that contemplated by the details of this bill has ever before been proposed or adopted .
they establish for the security of the colored race safeguards which go infinitely beyond any that the general government has ever provided for the white race .
in fact , the distinction of race and color is by the bill made to operate in favor of the colored and against the white race .
they interfere with the municipal legislation of the states , with the relations existing exclusively between a state and its citizens , or between inhabitants of the same state - an absorption and assumption of power by the general government which , if acquiesced in , must sap and destroy our federative system of limited powers and break down the barriers which preserve the rights of the states .
it is another step , or rather stride , toward centralization and the concentration of all legislative powers in the national government .
the tendency of the bill must be to resuscitate the spirit of rebellion and to arrest the progress of those influences which are more closely drawing around the states the bonds of union and peace .
my lamented predecessor , in his proclamation of the 1st of january , 1863 , ordered and declared that all persons held as slaves within certain states and parts of states therein designated were and thenceforward should be free ; and further , that the executive government of the united states , including the military and naval authorities thereof , would recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons .
this guaranty has been rendered especially obligatory and sacred by the amendment of the constitution abolishing slavery throughout the united states .
i therefore fully recognize the obligation to protect and defend that class of our people whenever and wherever it shall become necessary , and to the full extent compatible with the constitution of the united states .
entertaining these sentiments , it only remains for me to say that i will cheerfully cooperate with congress in any measure that may be necessary for the protection of the civil rights of the freedmen , as well as those of all other classes of persons throughout the united states , by judicial process , under equal and impartial laws , in conformity with the provisions of the federal constitution .
i now return the bill to the senate , and regret that in considering the bills and joint resolutions -- forty - two in number -- which have been thus far submitted for my approval i am compelled to withhold my assent from a second measure that has received the sanction of both houses of congress .

to the house of representatives : 
 the following " joint resolution , restoring tennessee to her relations in the union , " was last evening presented for my approval : 
 whereas in the year 1861 the government of the state of tennessee was seized upon and taken possession of by persons in hostility to the united states , and the inhabitants of said state , in pursuance of an act of congress , were declared to be in a state of insurrection against the united states : and 
 whereas said state government can only be restored to its former political relations in the union by the consent of the lawmaking power of the united states : and 
 whereas the people of said state did , on the 22d day of february , 1865 , by a large popular vote , adopt and ratify a constitution of government whereby slavery was abolished and all ordinances and laws of secession and debts contracted under the same were declared void ; and 
 whereas a state government has been organized under said constitution which has ratified the amendment to the constitution of the united states abolishing slavery , also the amendment proposed by the thirty - ninth congress , and has done other acts proclaiming and denoting loyalty : therefore , 
 be it resolved by the senate and house of representatives of the united states in congress assembled , that the state of tennessee is hereby restored to her former proper practical relations to the union , and is again entitled to be represented by senators and representatives in congress .
the preamble simply consists of statements , some of which are assumed , while the resolution is merely a declaration of opinion .
it comprises no legislation , nor does it confer any power which is binding upon the respective houses , the executive , or the states .
it does not admit to their seats in congress the senators and representatives from the state of tennessee , for , notwithstanding the passage of the resolution , each house , in the exercise of the constitutional right to judge for itself of the elections , returns , and qualifications of its members , may , at its discretion , admit them or continue to exclude them .
if a joint resolution of this kind were necessary and binding as a condition precedent to the admission of members of congress , it would happen , in the event of a veto by the executive , that senators and representatives could only be admitted to the halls of legislation by a two - thirds vote of each of the houses .
among other reasons recited in the preamble for the declaration contained in the resolution is the ratification by the state government of tennessee of " the amendment to the constitution of the united states abolishing slavery , also the amendment proposed by the thirty - ninth congress . "
if , as is also declared in the preamble , " said state government can only be restored to its former political relations in the union by the consent of the lawmaking power of the united states , " it would really seem to follow that the joint resolution which at this late day has received the sanction of congress should have been passed , approved , and placed on the statute books before any amendment to the constitution was submitted to the legislature of tennessee for ratification .
otherwise the inference is plainly deducible that while , in the opinion of congress , the people of a state may be too strongly disloyal to be entitled to representation , they may nevertheless , during the suspension of their " former proper practical relations to the union , " have an equally potent voice with other and loyal states in propositions to amend the constitution , upon which so essentially depend the stability , prosperity , and very , existence of the nation .
a brief reference to my annual message of the 4th of december last will show the steps taken by the executive for the restoration to their constitutional relations to the union of the states that had been affected by the rebellion .
upon the cessation of active hostilities provisional governors were appointed , conventions called , governors elected by the people , legislatures assembled , and senators and representatives chosen to the congress of the united states .
at the same time the courts of the united states were reopened , the blockade removed , the custom - houses reestablished , and postal operations resumed .
the amendment to the constitution abolishing slavery forever within the limits of the country was also submitted to the states , and they were thus invited to and did participate in its ratification , thus exercising the highest functions pertaining to a state .
in addition nearly all of these states , through their conventions and legislatures , had adopted and ratified constitutions " of government whereby slavery was abolished and all ordinances and laws of secession and debts contracted under the same were declared void . "
so far , then , the political existence of the states and their relations to the federal government had been fully and completely recognized and acknowledged by the executive department of the government ; and the completion of the work of restoration , which had progressed so favorably , was submitted to congress , upon which devolved all questions pertaining to the admission to their seats of the senators and representatives chosen from the states whose people had engaged in the rebellion .
all these steps had been taken when , on the 4th day of december , 1865 , the thirty - ninth congress assembled .
nearly eight months have elapsed since that time ; and no other plan of restoration having been proposed by congress for the measures instituted by the executive , it is now declared , in the joint resolution submitted for my approval , " that the state of tennessee is hereby restored to her former proper practical relations to the union , and is again entitled to be represented by senators and representatives in congress . "
thus , after the lapse of nearly eight months , congress proposes to pave the way to the admission to representation of one of the eleven states whose people arrayed themselves in rebellion against the constitutional authority of the federal government .
earnestly desiring to remove every cause of further delay , whether real or imaginary , on the part of congress to the admission to seats of loyal senators and representatives from the state of tennessee , i have , notwithstanding the anomalous character of this proceeding , affixed my signature to the resolution .
my approval , however , is not to be construed as an acknowledgment of the right of congress to pass laws preliminary to the admission of duly qualified representatives from any of the states .
neither is it to be considered as committing me to all the statements made in the preamble , some of which are , in my opinion , without foundation in fact , especially the assertion that the state of tennessee has ratified the amendment to the constitution of the united states proposed by the thirty - ninth congress .
no official notice of such ratification has been received by the executive or filed in the department of state ; on the contrary , unofficial information from the most reliable sources induces the belief that the amendment has not yet been constitutionally sanctioned by the legislature of tennessee .
the right of each house under the constitution to judge of the elections , returns , and qualifications of its own members is undoubted , and my approval or disapproval of the resolution could not in the slightest degree increase or diminish the authority in this respect conferred upon the two branches of congress .
in conclusion i can not too earnestly repeat my recommendation for the admission of tennessee , and all other states , to a fair and equal participation in national legislation when they present themselves in the persons of loyal senators and representatives who can comply with all the requirements of the constitution and the laws .
by this means harmony and reconciliation will be effected , the practical relations of all the states to the federal government reestablished , and the work of restoration , inaugurated upon the termination of the war , successfully completed .

to the senate of the united states : 
 i return to the senate , in which house it originated , a bill entitled " an act to admit the state of colorado into the union , " to which i can not , consistently with my sense of duty , give my approval .
with the exception of an additional section , containing new provisions , it is substantially the same as the bill of a similar title passed by congress during the last session , submitted to the president for his approval , returned with the objections contained in a message beating date the 15th of may last , and yet awaiting the reconsideration of the senate .
a second bill , having in view the same purpose , has now passed both houses of congress and been presented for my signature .
having again carefully considered the subject , i have been unable to perceive any reason for changing the opinions which have already been communicated to congress .
i find , on the contrary , that there are many objections to the proposed legislation of which i was not at that time aware , and that while several of those which i then assigned have in the interval gained in strength , yet others have been created by the altered character of the measures now submitted .
the constitution under which the state government is proposed to be formed very properly contains a provision that all laws in force at the time of its adoption and the admission of the state into the union shall continue as if the constitution had not been adopted .
among those laws is one absolutely prohibiting negroes and mulattoes from voting .
at the recent session of the territorial legislature a bill for the repeal of this law , introduced into the council , was almost unanimously rejected ; and at the very time when congress was engaged in enacting the bill now under consideration the legislature passed an act excluding negroes and mulattoes from the right to sit as jurors .
this bill was vetoed by the governor of the territory , who held that by the laws of the united states negroes and mulattoes are citizens , and subject to the duties , as well as entitled to the rights , of citizenship .
the bill , however , was passed , the objections of the governor to the contrary notwithstanding , and is now a law of the territory .
yet in the bill now before me by which it is proposed to admit the territory as a state , it is provided that " there shall be no denial of the elective franchise or any other rights to any person by reason of race or color , excepting indians not taxed . "
the incongruity thus exhibited between the legislation of congress and that of the territory , taken in connection with the protest against the admission of the state hereinafter referred to , would seem clearly to indicate the impolicy and injustice of the proposed enactment .
it might , indeed , be a subject of grave inquiry , and doubtless will result in such inquiry if this bill becomes a law , whether it does not attempt to exercise a power not conferred upon congress by the federal constitution .
that instrument simply declares that congress may admit new states into the union .
it nowhere says that congress may make new states for the purpose of admitting them into the union or for any other purpose ; and yet this bill is as clear an attempt to make the institutions as any in which the people themselves could engage .
in view of this action of congress , the house of representatives of the territory have earnestly protested against being forced into the union without first having the question submitted to the people .
nothing would be more reasonable than the position which they thus assume ; and it certainly can not be the purpose of congress to force upon a community against their will a government which they do not believe themselves capable of sustaining .
the following is a copy of the protest alluded to as officially transmitted to me : 
 whereas it is announced in the public prints that it is the intention of congress to admit colorado as a state into the union : therefore , 
 resolved by the house of representatives of the territory , that , representing , as we do , the last and only legal expression of public opinion on this question , we earnestly protest against the passage of a law admitting the state without first having the question submitted to a vote of the people , for the reasons , first , that we have a right to a voice in the selection of the character of our government ; second , that we have not a sufficient population to support the expenses of a state government .
for these reasons we trust that congress will not force upon us a government against our will .
upon information which i considered reliable , i assumed in my message of the 15th of may last that the population of colorado was not more than 30,000 , and expressed the opinion that this number was entirely too small either to assume the responsibilities or to enjoy the privileges of a state .
it appears that previous to that time the legislature , with a view to ascertain the exact condition of the territory , had passed a law authorizing a census of the population to be taken .
the law made it the duty of the assessors in the several counties to take the census in connection with the annual assessments , and , in order to secure a correct enumeration of the population , allowed them a liberal compensation for the service by paying them for every name returned , and added to their previous oath of office an oath to perform this duty with fidelity .
from the accompanying official report it appears that returns have been received from fifteen of the eighteen counties into which the state is divided , and that their population amounts in the aggregate to 24,909 .
the three remaining counties are estimated to contain 3,000 , making a total population of 27,909 .
this census was taken in the summer season , when it is claimed that the population is much larger than at any other period , as in the autumn miners in large numbers leave their work and return to the east with the results of their summer enterprise .
the population , it will be observed , is but slightly in excess of one - fifth of the number required as the basis of representation for a single congressional district in any of the states -- the number being 127,000 .
i am unable to perceive any good reason for such great disparity in the right of representation , giving , as it would , to the people of colorado not only this vast advantage in the house of representatives , but an equality in the senate , where the other states are represented by millions .
with perhaps a single exception , no such inequality as this has ever before been attempted .
i know that it is claimed that the population of the different states at the time of their admission has varied at different periods , but it has not varied much more than the population of each decade and the corresponding basis of representation for the different periods .
the obvious intent of the constitution was that no state should be admitted with a less population than the ratio for a representative at the time of application .
the limitation in the second section of the first article of the constitution , declaring that " each state shall have at least one representative , " was manifestly designed to protect the states which originally composed the union from being deprived , in the event of a waning population , of a voice in the popular branch of congress , and was never intended as a warrant to force a new state into the union with a representative population far below that which might at the time be required of sister members of the confederacy .
this bill , in view of the prohibition of the same section , which declares that " the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every 30,000 , " is at least a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the constitution .
it is respectfully submitted that however congress , under the pressure of circumstances , may have admitted two or three states with less than a representative population at the time , there has been no instance in which an application for admission has ever been entertained when the population , as officially ascertained , was below 30,000 .
were there any doubt of this being the true construction of the constitution , it would be dispelled by the early and long - continued practice of the federal government .
for nearly sixty years after the adoption of the constitution no state was admitted with a population believed at the time to be less than the current ratio for a representative , and the first instance in which there appears to have been a departure from the principle was in 1845 , in the case of florida .
obviously the result of sectional strife , we would do well to regard it as a warning of evil rather than as are example for imitation ; and i think candid men of all parties will agree that the inspiring cause of the violation of this wholesome principle of restraint is to be found in a vain attempt to balance these antagonisms which refused to be reconciled except through the bloody arbitrament of arms .
the plain facts of our history will attest that the great and leading states admitted since 1845 , viz , iowa , wisconsin , california , minnesota , and kansas , including texas , which was admitted that year , have all come with an ample population for one representative , and some of them with nearly or quite enough for two .
to demonstrate the correctness of my views on this question , i subjoin a table containing a list of the states admitted since the adoption of the federal constitution , with the date of admission , the ratio of representation , and the representative population when admitted , deduced from the united states census tables , the calculation being made for the period of the decade corresponding with the date of admission .
colorado , which it is now proposed to admit as a state , contains , as has already been stated , a population less than 28,000 , while the present ratio of representation is 127,000 .
there can be no reason that i can perceive for the admission of colorado that would not apply with equal force to nearly every other territory now organized ; and i submit whether , if this bill become a law , it will be possible to resist the logical conclusion that such territories as dakota , montana , and idaho must be received as states whenever they present themselves , without regard to the number of inhabitants they may respectively contain .
eight or ten new senators and four or five new members of the house of representatives would thus be admitted to represent a population scarcely exceeding that which in any other portion of the nation is entitled to but a single member of the house of representatives , while the average for two senators in the union , as now constituted , is at least 1,000,000 people .
it would surely be unjust to all other sections of the union to enter upon a policy with regard to the admission of new states which might result in conferring such a disproportionate share of influence in the national legislature upon communities which , in pursuance of the wise policy of our fathers , should for some years to come be retained under the fostering care and protection of the national government .
if it is deemed just and expedient now to depart from the settled policy of the nation during all its history , and to admit all the territories to the rights and privileges of states , irrespective of their population or fitness for such government , it is submitted whether it would not be well to devise such measures as will bring the subject before the country for consideration and decision .
this would seem to be eminently wise , because , as has already been stated , if it is right to admit colorado now there is no reason for the exclusion of the other territories .
it is no answer to these suggestions that an enabling act was passed authorizing the people of colorado to take action on this subject .
it is well known that that act was passed in consequence of representations that the population reached , according to some statements , as high as 80,000 , and to none less than 50,000 , and was growing with a rapidity which by the time the admission could be consummated would secure a population of over 100,000 .
these representations proved to have been wholly fallacious , and in addition the people of the territory by a deliberate vote decided that they would not assume the responsibilities of a state government .
by that decision they utterly exhausted all power that was conferred by the enabling act , and there has been no step taken since in relation to the admission that has had the slightest sanction or warrant of law .
the proceeding upon which the present application is based was in the utter absence of all law in relation to it , and there is no evidence that the votes on the question of the formation of a state government bear any relation whatever to the sentiment of the territory .
the protest of the house of representatives previously quoted is conclusive evidence to the contrary .
but if none of these reasons existed against this proposed enactment , the bill itself , besides being inconsistent in its provisions in conferring power upon a person unknown to the laws and who may never have a legal existence , is so framed as to render its execution almost impossible .
it is , indeed , a question whether it is not in itself a nullity .
to say the least , it is of exceedingly doubtful propriety to confer the power proposed in this bill upon the " governor elect , " for as by its own terms the constitution is not to take effect until after the admission of the state , he in the meantime has no more authority than any other private citizen .
but even supposing him to be clothed with sufficient authority to convene the legislature , what constitutes the " state legislature " to which is to be referred the submission of the conditions imposed by congress ?
is it a new body to be elected and convened by proclamation of the " governor elect , " or is it that body which met more than a year ago under the provisions of the state constitution ?
by reference to the second section of the schedule and to the eighteenth section of the fourth article of the state constitution it will be seen that the term of the members of the house of representatives and that of one - half of the members of the senate expired on the first monday of the present month .
it is clear that if there were no intrinsic objections to the bill itself in relation to purposes to be accomplished this objection would be fatal , as it is apparent that the provisions of the third section of the bill to admit colorado have reference to a period and a state of facts entirely different from the present and affairs as they now exist , and if carried into effect must necessarily lead to confusion .
even if it were settled that the old and not a new body were to act , it would be found impracticable to execute the law , because a considerable number of the members , as i am informed , have ceased to be residents of the territory , and in the sixty days within which the legislature is to be convened after the passage of the act there would not be sufficient time to fill the vacancies by new elections , were there any authority under which they could be held .
it may not be improper to add that if these proceedings were all regular and the result to be obtained were desirable , simple justice to the people of the territory would require a longer period than sixty days within which to obtain action on the conditions proposed by the third section of the bill .
there are , as is well known , large portions of the territory with which there is and can be no general communication there being several counties which from november to may can only be reached by persons traveling on foot , while with other regions of the territory , occupied by a large portion of the population , there is very little more freedom of access .
thus , if this bill should become a law , it would be impracticable to obtain any expression of public sentiment in reference to its provisions , with a view to enlighten the legislature , if the old body were called together , and , of course , equally impracticable to procure the election of a new body .
this defect might have been remedied by an extension of the time and a submission of the question to the people , with a fair opportunity to enable them to express their sentiments .
the admission of a new state has generally been regarded as an epoch in our history marking the onward progress of the nation ; but after the most careful and anxious inquiry on the subject i can not perceive that the proposed proceeding is in conformity with the policy which from the origin of the government has uniformly prevailed in the admission of new states .
i therefore return the bill to the senate without my signature .

to the house of representatives : 
 i have considered the bill entitled " an act supplementary to an act entitled ' an act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel states , ' passed march 2 , 1867 , and to facilitate restoration " and now return it to the house of representatives with my objections .
this bill provides for elections in the ten states brought under the operation of the original act to which it is supplementary .
its details are principally directed to the elections for the formation of the state constitutions , but by the sixth section of the bill " all elections " in these states occurring while the original act remains in force are brought within its purview .
referring to these details , it will be found that , first of all , there is to be a registration of the voters .
no one whose name has not been admitted on the list is to be allowed to vote at any of these elections .
to ascertain who is entitled to registration , reference is made necessary , by the express language of the supplement , to the original act and to the pending bill .
the fifth section of the original act provides , as to voters , that they shall be " male citizens of the state , 21 years old and upward , of whatever race , color , or previous condition , who have been residents of said state for one year . "
this is the general qualification , followed , however , by many exceptions .
no one can be registered , according to the original act , " who may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion "-- a provision which left undetermined the question as to what amounted to disfranchisement , and whether without a judicial sentence the act itself produced that effect .
this supplemental bill superadds an oath , to be taken by every person before his name can be admitted upon the registration , that he has " not been disfranchised for participation in any rebellion or civil war against the united states . "
it thus imposes upon every person the necessity and responsibility of deciding for himself , under the peril of punishment by a military commission if he makes a mistake , what works disfranchisement by participation in rebellion and what amounts to such participation .
almost every man -- the negro as well as the white -- above 21 years of age who was resident in these ten states during the rebellion , voluntarily or involuntarily , at some time and in some way did participate in resistance to the lawful authority of the general government .
the question with the citizen to whom this oath is to be proposed must be a fearful one , for while the bill does not declare that perjury may be assigned for such false swearing nor fix any penalty for the offense , we must not forget that martial law prevails ; that every person is answerable to a military commission , without previous presentment by a grand jury , for any charge that may be made against him , and that the supreme authority of the military commander determines the question as to what is an offense and what is to be the measure of punishment .
the fourth section of the bill provides " that the commanding general of each district shall appoint as many boards of registration as may be necessary , consisting of three loyal officers or persons . "
the only qualification stated for these officers is that they must be " loyal . "
they may be persons in the military service or civilians , residents of the state or strangers .
yet these persons are to exercise most important duties and are vested with unlimited discretion .
they are to decide what names shall be placed upon the register and from their decision there is to be no appeal .
they are to superintend the elections and to decide all questions which may arise .
they are to have the custody of the ballots and to make return of the persons elected .
whatever frauds or errors they may commit must pass without redress .
all that is left for the commanding general is to receive the returns of the elections , open the same , and ascertain who are chosen " according to the returns of the officers who conducted said elections . "
by such means and with this sort of agency are the conventions of delegates to be constituted .
as the delegates are to speak for the people , common justice would seem to require that they should have authority from the people themselves .
no convention so constituted will in any sense represent the wishes of the inhabitants of these states , for under the all - embracing exceptions of these laws , by a construction which the uncertainty of the clause as to disfranchisement leaves open to the board of officers , the great body of the people may be excluded from the polls and from all opportunity of expressing their own wishes or voting for delegates who will faithfully reflect their sentiments .
i do not deem it necessary further to investigate the details of this bill .
no consideration could induce me to give my approval to such an election law for any purpose , and especially for the great purpose of framing the constitution of a state .
if ever the american citizen should be left to the free exercise of his own judgment it is when he is engaged in the work of forming the fundamental law under which he is to live .
that work is his work , and it can not properly be taken out of his hands .
all this legislation proceeds upon the contrary assumption that the people of each of these states shall have no constitution except such as may be arbitrarily dictated by congress and formed under the restraint of military rule .
a plain statement of facts makes this evident .
in all these states there are existing constitutions , framed in the accustomed way by the people .
congress , however , declares that these constitutions are not " loyal and republican , " and requires the people to form them anew .
what , then , in the opinion of congress , is necessary to make the constitution of a state " loyal and republican " ?
the original act answers the question : it is universal negro suffrage -- a question which the federal constitution leaves exclusively to the states themselves .
all this legislative machinery of martial law , military coercion , and political disfranchisement is avowedly for that purpose and none other .
the existing constitutions of the ten states conform to the acknowledged standards of loyalty and republicanism .
indeed , if there are degrees in republican forms of government , their constitutions are more republican now than when these states , four of which were members of the original thirteen , first became members of the union .
congress does not now demand that a single provision of their constitutions be changed except such as confine suffrage to the white population .
it is apparent , therefore , that these provisions do not conform to the standard of republicanism which congress seeks to establish .
that there may be no mistake , it is only necessary that reference should be made to the original act , which declares " such constitution shall provide that the elective franchise shall be enjoyed by all such persons as have the qualifications herein stated for electors of delegates . "
what class of persons is here meant clearly appears in the same section ; that is to say , " the male citizens of said state 21 years old and upward , of whatever race , color , or previous condition , who have been resident in said state for one year previous to the day of such election . "
without these provisions no constitution which can be framed in any one of the ten states will be of any avail with congress .
this , then , is the test of what the constitution of a state of this union must contain to make it republican .
measured by such a standard , how few of the states now composing the union have republican constitutions if in the exercise of the constitutional guaranty that congress shall secure to every state a republican form of government universal suffrage for blacks as well as whites is a sine qua non , the work of reconstruction may as well begin in ohio as in virginia , in pennsylvania as in north carolina .
when i contemplate the millions of our fellow - citizens of the south with no alternative left but to impose upon themselves this fearful and untried experiment of complete negro enfranchisement -- and white disfranchisement , it may be , almost as complete -- or submit indefinitely to the rigor of martial law , without a single attribute of freemen , deprived of all the sacred guaranties of our federal constitution , and threatened with even worse wrongs , if any worse are possible , it seems to me their condition is the most deplorable to which any people can be reduced .
it is true that they have been engaged in rebellion and that their object being a separation of the states and a dissolution of the union there was an obligation resting upon every loyal citizen to treat them as enemies and to wage war against their cause .
inflexibly opposed to any movement imperiling the integrity of the government , i did not hesitate to urge the adoption of all measures necessary for the suppression of the insurrection .
after a long and terrible struggle the efforts of the government were triumphantly successful , and the people of the south , submitting to the stern arbitrament , yielded forever the issues of the contest .
hostilities terminated soon after it became my duty to assume the responsibilities of the chief executive officer of the republic , and i at once endeavored to repress and control the passions which our civil strife had engendered , and , no longer regarding these erring millions as enemies , again acknowledged them as our friends and our countrymen .
the war had accomplished its objects .
the nation was saved and that seminal principle of mischief which from the birth of the government had gradually but inevitably brought on the rebellion was totally eradicated .
then , it seemed to me , was the auspicious time to commence the work of reconciliation ; then , when these people sought once more our friendship and protection , i considered it our duty generously to meet them in the spirit of charity and forgiveness and to conquer them even more effectually by the magnanimity of the nation than by the force of its arms .
i yet believe that if the policy of reconciliation then inaugurated , and which contemplated an early restoration of these people to all their political rights , had received the support of congress , every one of these ten states and all their people would at this moment be fast anchored in the union and the great work which gave the war all its sanction and made it just and holy would have been accomplished .
then over all the vast and fruitful regions of the south peace and its blessings would have prevailed , while now millions are deprived of rights guaranteed by the constitution to every citizen and after nearly two years of legislation find themselves placed under an absolute military despotism . "
a military republic , a government rounded on mock elections and supported only by the sword , " was nearly a quarter of a century since pronounced by daniel webster , when speaking of the south american states , as " a movement , indeed , but a retrograde and disastrous movement , from the regular and old - fashioned monarchical systems ; " and he added : 
 if men would enjoy the blessings of republican government , they must govern themselves by reason , by mutual counsel and consultation , by a sense and feeling of general interest , and by the acquiescence of the minority in the will of the majority , properly expressed ; and , above all , the military must be kept , according to the language of our bill of rights , in strict subordination to the civil authority .
wherever this lesson is not both learned and practiced there can be no political freedom .
absurd , preposterous is it , a scoff and a satire on free forms of constitutional liberty , for frames of government to be prescribed by military leaders and the right of suffrage to be exercised at the point of the sword .
i confidently believe that a time will come when these states will again occupy their true positions in the union .
the barriers which now seem so obstinate must yield to the force of an enlightened and just public opinion , and sooner or later unconstitutional and oppressive legislation will be effaced from our statute books .
when this shall have been consummated , i pray god that the errors of the past may be forgotten and that once more we shall be a happy , united , and prosperous people , and that at last , after the bitter and eventful experience through which the nation has passed , we shall all come to know that our only safety is in the preservation of our federal constitution and in according to every american citizen and to every state the rights which that constitution secures .

whereas it appears from evidence in the bureau of military justice that the atrocious murder of the late president , abraham lincoln , and the attempted assassination of the hon .
william h. seward , secretary of state , were incited , concerted , and procured by and between jefferson davis , late of richmond , va. , and jacob thompson , clement c. clay , beverley tucker , george n. sanders , william c. cleary , and other rebels and traitors against the government of the united states harbored in canada : 
 now , therefore , to the end that justice may be done , i , andrew johnson , president of the united states , do offer and promise for the arrest of said persons , or either of them , within the limits of the united states , so that they can be brought to trial , the following rewards : 
 one hundred thousand dollars for the arrest of jefferson davis .
twenty - five thousand dollars for the arrest of clement c. clay .
twenty - five thousand dollars for the arrest of jacob thompson , late of mississippi .
twenty - five thousand dollars for the arrest of george n. sanders .
twenty - five thousand dollars for the arrest of beverley tucker .
ten thousand dollars for the arrest of william c. cleary , late clerk of clement c. clay .
the provost - marshal - general of the united states is directed to cause a description of said persons , with notice of the above rewards , to be published .
in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed .
done at the city of washington , this 2d day of may , a. d. 1865 , and of the independence of the united states of america the eighty - ninth .

andrew johnson .
by the president : 
 w. hunter , 
 acting secretary of state
fellow - citizens of the senate and house of representatives : 
 upon the reassembling of congress it again becomes my duty to call your attention to the state of the union and to its continued disorganized condition under the various laws which have been passed upon the subject of reconstruction .
it may be safely assumed as an axiom in the government of states that the greatest wrongs inflicted upon a people are caused by unjust and arbitrary legislation , or by the unrelenting decrees of despotic rulers , and that the timely revocation of injurious and oppressive measures is the greatest good that can be conferred upon a nation .
the legislator or ruler who has the wisdom and magnanimity to retrace his steps when convinced of error will sooner or later be rewarded with the respect and gratitude of an intelligent and patriotic people .
our own history , although embracing a period less than a century , affords abundant proof that most , if not all , of our domestic troubles are directly traceable to violations of the organic law and excessive legislation .
the most striking illustrations of this fact are furnished by the enactments of the past three years upon the question of reconstruction .
after a fair trial they have substantially failed and proved pernicious in their results , and there seems to be no good reason why they should longer remain upon the statute book .
states to which the constitution guarantees a republican form of government have been reduced to military dependencies in each of which the people have been made subject to the arbitrary will of the commanding general .
although the constitution requires that each state shall be represented in congress , virginia , mississippi , and texas are yet excluded from the two houses , and , contrary to the express provisions of that instrument were denied participation in the recent election for a president and vice - president of the united states .
the attempt to place the white population under the domination of persons of color in the south has impaired , if not destroyed , the kindly relations that had previously existed between them : and mutual distrust has engendered a feeling of animosity which leading in some instances to collision and bloodshed , has prevented that cooperation between the two races so essential to the success of industrial enterprise in the southern states .
nor have the inhabitants of those states alone suffered from the disturbed condition of affairs growing out of these congressional enactments .
the entire union has been agitated by grave apprehensions of troubles which might again involve the peace of the nation ; its interests have been injuriously affected by the derangement of business and labor , and the consequent want of prosperity throughout that portion of the country .
the federal constitution -- the magna charta of american rights , under whose wise and salutary provisions we have successfully conducted all our domestic and foreign affairs , sustained ourselves in peace and in war , and become a great nation among the powers of the earth -- must assuredly be now adequate to the settlement of questions growing out of the civil war , waged alone for its vindication .
this great fact is made most manifest by the condition of the country when congress assembled in the month of december , 1865 .
civil strife had ceased , the spirit of rebellion had spent its entire force , in the southern states the people had warmed into national life , and throughout the whole country a healthy reaction in public sentiment had taken place .
by the application of the simple yet effective provisions of the constitution the executive department , with the voluntary aid of the states , had brought the work of restoration as near completion as was within the scope of its authority , and the nation was encouraged by the prospect of an early and satisfactory adjustment of all its difficulties .
congress , however , intervened , and , refusing to perfect the work so nearly consummated , declined to admit members from the unrepresented states , adopted a series of measures which arrested the progress of restoration , frustrated all that had been so successfully accomplished , and , after three years of agitation and strife , has left the country further from the attainment of union and fraternal feeling than at the inception of the congressional plan of reconstruction .
it needs no argument to show that legislation which has produced such baneful consequences should be abrogated , or else made to conform to the genuine principles of republican government .
under the influence of party passion and sectional prejudice , other acts have been passed not warranted by the constitution .
congress has already been made familiar with my views respecting the " tenure - of - office bill . "
experience has proved that its repeal is demanded by the best interests of the country , and that while it remains in force the president can not enjoin that rigid accountability of public officers so essential to an honest and efficient execution of the laws .
its revocation would enable the executive department to exercise the power of appointment and removal in accordance with the original design of the federal constitution .
the act of march 2 , 1867 , making appropriations for the support of the army for the year ending june 30 , 1868 , and for other purposes , contains provisions which interfere with the president 's constitutional functions as commander in chief of the army and deny to states of the union the right to protect themselves by means of their own militia .
these provisions should be at once annulled ; for while the first might , in times of great emergency , seriously embarrass the executive in efforts to employ and direct the common strength of the nation for its protection and preservation , the other is contrary to the express declaration of the constitution that " a well - regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . "
it is believed that the repeal of all such laws would be accepted by the american people as at least a partial return to the fundamental principles of the government , and an indication that hereafter the constitution is to be made the nation 's safe and unerring guide .
they can be productive of no permanent benefit to the country , and should not be permitted to stand as so many monuments of the deficient wisdom which has characterized our recent legislation .
the condition of our finances demands the early and earnest consideration of congress .
compared with the growth of our population , the public expenditures have reached an amount unprecedented in our history .
the population of the united states in 1790 was nearly 4,000,000 people .
increasing each decade about 33 per cent , it reached in 1860 31,000,000 , an increase of 700 per cent on the population in 1790 .
in 1869 it is estimated that it will reach 38,000,000 , or an increase of 868 per cent in seventy - nine years .
the annual expenditures of the federal government in 1791 were $ 4,200,000 ; in 1820 , $ 18.200,000 ; in 1850 , forty - one millions ; in 1860 , sixty - three millions ; in 1865 , nearly thirteen hundred millions ; and in 1869 it is estimated by the secretary of the treasury , in his last annual report , that they will be three hundred and seventy - two millions .
by comparing the public disbursements of 1869 , as estimated , with those of 1791 , it will be seen that the increase of expenditure since the beginning of the government has been 8,618 per cent , while the increase of the population for the same period was only 868 per cent .
again , the expenses of the government in 1860 , the year of peace immediately preceding the war , were only sixty -- three millions , while in 1869 , the year of peace three years after the war it is estimated they will be three hundred and seventy - two millions , an increase of 489 per cent , while the increase of population was only 21 per cent for the same period .
these statistics further show that in 1791 the annual national expenses , compared with the population , were little more than $ 1 per capita , and in 1860 but $ 2 per capita ; while in 1869 they will reach the extravagant sum of $ 9.78 per capita .
it will be observed that all these statements refer to and exhibit the disbursements of peace periods .
it may , therefore , be of interest to compare the expenditures of the three war periods -- the war with great britain , the mexican war , and the war of the rebellion .
in 1814 the annual expenses incident to the war of 1812 reached their highest amount -- about thirty - one millions -- while our population slightly exceeded 8,000,000 , showing an expenditure of only $ 3.80 per capita .
in 1847 the expenditures growing out of the war with mexico reached fifty - five millions , and the population about 21,000,000 , giving only $ 2.60 per capita for the war expenses of that year .
in 1865 the expenditures called for by the rebellion reached the vast amount of twelve hundred and ninety millions , which , compared with a population of 34,000,000 , gives $ 38.20 per capita .
from the 4th day of march , 1789 , to the 30th of june , 1861 , the entire expenditures of the government were $ 1,700,000,000 .
during that period we were engaged in wars with great britain and mexico , and were involved in hostilities with powerful indian tribes ; louisiana was purchased from france at a cost of $ 15,000,000 ; florida was ceded to us by spain for five millions ; california was acquired from mexico for fifteen millions , and the territory of new mexico was obtained from texas for the sum of ten millions .
early in 1861 the war of the rebellion commenced ; and from the 1st of july of that year to the 30th of june , 1865 , the public expenditures reached the enormous aggregate of thirty - three hundred millions .
three years of peace have intervened , and during that time the disbursements of the government have successively been five hundred and twenty millions , three hundred and forty - six millions , and three hundred and ninety - three millions .
adding to these amounts three hundred and seventy - two millions , estimated as necessary for the fiscal year ending the 30th of june , 1869 , we obtain a total expenditure of $ 1,600,000,000 during the four years immediately succeeding the war , or nearly as much as was expended during the seventy - two years that preceded the rebellion and embraced the extraordinary expenditures already named .
these startling facts clearly illustrate the necessity of retrenchment in all branches of the public service .
abuses which were tolerated during the war for the preservation of the nation will not be endured by the people , now that profound peace prevails .
the receipts from internal revenues and customs have during the past three years gradually diminished , and the continuance of useless and extravagant expenditures will involve us in national bankruptcy , or else make inevitable an increase of taxes , already too onerous and in many respects obnoxious on account of their inquisitorial character .
one hundred millions annually are expended for the military force , a large portion of which is employed in the execution of laws both unnecessary and unconstitutional ; one hundred and fifty millions are required each year to pay the interest on the public debt : an army of taxgatherers impoverishes the nation , and public agents , placed by congress beyond the control of the executive , divert from their legitimate purposes large sums of money which they collect from the people in the name of the government .
judicious legislation and prudent economy can alone remedy defects and avert evils which , if suffered to exist , can not fail to diminish confidence in the public councils and weaken the attachment and respect of the people toward their political institutions .
without proper care the small balance which it is estimated will remain in the treasury at the close of the present fiscal year will not be realized , and additional millions be added to a debt which is now enumerated by billions .
it is shown by the able and comprehensive report of the secretary of the treasury that the receipts for the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1868 , were $ 405,638,083 , and that the expenditures for the same period were $ 377,340,284 , leaving in the treasury a surplus of $ 28,297,798 .
it is estimated that the receipts during the present fiscal year , ending june 30 , 1869 , will be $ 341,392,868 and the expenditures $ 336,152,470 , showing a small balance of $ 5,240,398 in favor of the government .
for the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1870 , it is estimated that the receipts will amount to $ 327,000,000 and the expenditures to $ 303,000,000 , leaving an estimated surplus of $ 24,000,000 .
it becomes proper in this connection to make a brief reference to our public indebtedness , which has accumulated with such alarming rapidity and assumed such colossal proportions .
in 1789 , when the government commenced operations under the federal constitution , it was burdened with an indebtedness of $ 75,000,000 , created during the war of the revolution .
this amount had been reduced to $ 45,000,000 when , in 1812 , war was declared against great britain .
the three years ' struggle that followed largely increased the national obligations , and in 1816 they had attained the sum of $ 127,000,000 .
wise and economical legislation , however , enabled the government to pay the entire amount within a period of twenty years , and the extinguishment of the national debt filled the land with rejoicing and was one of the great events of president jackson 's administration .
after its redemption a large fund remained in the treasury , which was deposited for safe - keeping with the several states .
on condition that it should be returned when required by the public wants .
in 1849 - -the year after the termination of an expensive war with mexico -- we found ourselves involved in a debt of $ 64,000,000 ; and this was the amount owed by the government in 1860 , just prior to the outbreak of the rebellion .
in the spring of 1861 our civil war commenced .
each year of its continuance made an enormous addition to the debt : and when .
in the spring of 1865 , the nation successfully emerged from the conflict , the obligations of the government had reached the immense sum of $ 2.873,992,909 .
the secretary of the treasury shows that on the 1st day of november , 1867 , this amount had been reduced to $ 2,491,504,450 ; but at the same time his report exhibits an increase during the past year of $ 35,625,102 , for the debt on the 1st day of november last is stated to have been $ 2,527,129,552 .
it is estimated by the secretary that the returns for the past month will add to our liabilities the further sum of $ 11,000,000 , making a total increase during thirteen months of $ 46,500,000 .
in my message to congress december 4 , 1865 , it was suggested that a policy should be devised which , without being oppressive to the people , would at once begin to effect a reduction of the debt , and , if persisted in , discharge it fully within a definite number of years .
the secretary of the treasury forcibly recommends legislation of this character , and justly urges that the longer it is deferred the more difficult must become its accomplishment .
we should follow the wise precedents established in 1789 and 1816 , and without further delay make provision for the payment of our obligations at as early a period as may be practicable .
the fruits of their labors should be enjoyed by our citizens rather than used to build up and sustain moneyed monopolies in our own and other lands .
our foreign debt is already computed by the secretary of the treasury at $ 850,000,000 ; citizens of foreign countries receive interest upon a large portion of our securities , and american taxpayers are made to contribute large sums for their support .
the idea that such a debt is to become permanent should be at all times discarded as involving taxation too heavy to be borne .
and payment once in every sixteen years , at the present rate of interest , of an amount equal to the original sum .
this vast debt , if permitted to become permanent and increasing , must eventually be gathered into the hands of a few , and enable them to exert a dangerous and controlling power in the affairs of the government .
the borrowers would become servants to the lenders , the lenders the masters of the people .
we now pride ourselves upon having given freedom to 4,000,000 of the colored race ; it will then be our shame that 40,000,000 of people , by their own toleration of usurpation and profligacy , have suffered themselves to become enslaved , and merely exchanged slave owners for new taskmasters in the shape of bondholders and taxgatherers .
besides , permanent debts pertain to monarchical governments , and , tending to monopolies , perpetuities , and class legislation , are totally irreconcilable with free institutions .
introduced into our republican system , they would gradually but surely sap its foundations , eventually subvert our governmental fabric , and erect upon its ruins a moneyed aristocracy .
it is our sacred duty to transmit unimpaired to our posterity the blessings of liberty which were bequeathed to us by the founders of the republic , and by our example teach those who are to follow us carefully to avoid the dangers which threaten a free and independent people .
various plans have been proposed for the payment of the public debt .
however they may have varied as to the time and mode in which it should be redeemed , there seems to be a general concurrence as to the propriety and justness of a reduction in the present rate of interest .
the secretary of the treasury in his report recommends 5 per cent ; congress , in a bill passed prior to adjournment on the 27th of july last , agreed upon 4 and 4 1/2 per cent ; while by many 3 per cent has been held to be an amply sufficient return for the investment .
the general impression as to the exorbitancy of the existing rate of interest has led to an inquiry in the public mind respecting the consideration which the government has actually received for its bonds , and the conclusion is becoming prevalent that the amount which it obtained was in real money three or four hundred per cent less than the obligations which it issued in return .
it can not be denied that we are paying an extravagant percentage for the use of the money borrowed , which was paper currency , greatly depreciated below the value of coin .
this fact is made apparent when we consider that bondholders receive from the treasury upon each dollar they own in government securities 6 per cent in gold , which is nearly or quite equal to 9 per cent in currency ; that the bonds are then converted into capital for the national banks , upon which those institutions issue their circulation , bearing 6 per cent interest ; and that they are exempt from taxation by the government and the states , and thereby enhanced 2 per cent in the hands of the holders .
we thus have an aggregate of 17 per cent which may be received upon each dollar by the owners of government securities .
a system that produces such results is justly regarded as favoring a few at the expense of the many , and has led to the further inquiry whether our bondholders , in view of the large profits which they have enjoyed , would themselves be averse to a settlement of our indebtedness upon a plan which would yield them a fair remuneration and at the same time be just to the taxpayers of the nation .
our national credit should be sacredly observed , but in making provision for our creditors we should not forget what is due to the masses of the people .
it may be assumed that the holders of our securities have already received upon their bonds a larger amount than their original investment , measured by a gold standard .
upon this statement of facts it would seem but just and equitable that the 6 per cent interest now paid by the government should be applied to the reduction of the principal in semiannual installments , which in sixteen years and eight months would liquidate the entire national debt .
six per cent in gold would at present rates be equal to 9 per cent in currency , and equivalent to the payment of the debt one and a half times in a fraction less than seventeen years .
this , in connection with all the other advantages derived from their investment , would afford to the public creditors a fair and liberal compensation for the use of their capital , and with this they should be satisfied .
the lessons of the past admonish the lender that it is not well to be over - anxious in exacting from the borrower rigid compliance with the letter of the bond .
if provision be made for the payment of the indebtedness of the government in the manner suggested , our nation will rapidly recover its wonted prosperity .
its interests require that some measure should be taken to release the large amount of capital invested in the securities of the government .
it is not now merely unproductive , but in taxation annually consumes $ 150,000,000 , which would otherwise be used by our enterprising people in adding to the wealth of the nation .
our commerce , which at one time successfully rivaled that of the great maritime powers , has rapidly diminished , and our industrial interests are in a depressed and languishing condition .
the development of our inexhaustible resources is checked , and the fertile fields of the south are becoming waste for want of means to till them .
with the release of capital , new life would be infused into the paralyzed energies of our people and activity and vigor imparted to every branch of industry .
our people need encouragement in their efforts to recover from the effects of the rebellion and of injudicious legislation , and it should be the aim of the government to stimulate them by the prospect of an early release from the burdens which impede their prosperity .
if we can not take the burdens from their shoulders , we should at least manifest a willingness to help to bear them .
in referring to the condition of the circulating medium , i shall merely reiterate substantially that portion of my last annual message which relates to that subject .
the proportion which the currency of any country should bear to the whole value of the annual produce circulated by its means is a question upon which political economists have not agreed .
nor can it be controlled by legislation , but must be left to the irrevocable laws which everywhere regulate commerce and trade .
the circulating medium will ever irresistibly flow to those points where it is in greatest demand .
the law of demand and supply is as unerring as that which regulates the tides of the ocean ; and , indeed , currency , like the tides , has its ebbs and flows throughout the commercial world .
at the beginning of the rebellion the bank - note circulation of the country amounted to not much more than $ 200,000,000 ; now the circulation of national - bank notes and those known as " legal - tenders " is nearly seven hundred millions .
while it is urged by some that this amount should be increased , others contend that a decided reduction is absolutely essential to the best interests of the country .
in view of these diverse opinions , it may be well to ascertain the real value of our paper issues when compared with a metallic or convertible currency .
for this purpose let us inquire how much gold and silver could be purchased by the seven hundred millions of paper money now in circulation .
probably not more than half the amount of the latter ; showing that when our paper currency is compared with gold and silver its commercial value is compressed into three hundred and fifty millions .
this striking fact makes it the obvious duty of the government , as early as may be consistent with the principles of sound political economy , to take such measures as will enable the holders of its notes and those of the national banks to convert them , without loss , into specie or its equivalent .
a reduction of our paper circulating medium need not necessarily follow .
this , however , would depend upon the law of demand and supply , though it should be borne in mind that by making legal - tender and bank notes convertible into coin or its equivalent their present specie value in the hands of their holders would be enhanced 100 per cent .
legislation for the accomplishment of a result so desirable is demanded by the highest public considerations .
the constitution contemplates that the circulating medium of the country shall be uniform in quality and value .
at the time of the formation of that instrument the country had just emerged from the war of the revolution , and was suffering from the effects of a redundant and worthless paper currency .
the sages of that period were anxious to protect their posterity from the evils which they themselves had experienced .
hence in providing a circulating medium they conferred upon congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof , at the same time prohibiting the states from making anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts .
the anomalous condition of our currency is in striking contrast with that which was originally designed .
our circulation now embraces , first , notes of the national banks , which are made receivable for all dues to the government , excluding imposts , and by all its creditors , excepting in payment of interest upon its bonds and the securities themselves ; second , legal tender , issued by the united states , and which the law requires shall be received as well in payment of all debts between citizens as of all government dues , excepting imposts ; and , third , gold and silver coin .
by the operation of our present system of finance however , the metallic currency , when collected , is reserved only for one class of government creditors , who , holding its bonds , semiannually receive their interest in coin from the national treasury .
there is no reason which will be accepted as satisfactory by the people why those who defend us on the land and protect us on the sea ; the pensioner upon the gratitude of the nation , bearing the scars and wounds received while in its service ; the public servants in the various departments of the government ; the farmer who supplies the soldiers of the army and the sailors of the navy ; the artisan who toils in the nation 's workshops , or the mechanics and laborers who build its edifices and construct its forts and vessels of war , should , in payment of their just and hard - earned dues , receive depreciated paper , while another class of their countrymen , no more deserving are paid in coin of gold and silver .
equal and exact justice requires that all the creditors of the government should be paid in a currency possessing a uniform value .
this can only be accomplished by the restoration of the currency to the standard established by the constitution , and by this means we would remove a discrimination which may , if it has not already done so , create a prejudice that may become deep - rooted and widespread and imperil the national credit .
the feasibility of making our currency correspond with the constitutional standard may be seen by reference to a few facts derived from our commercial statistics .
the aggregate product of precious metals in the united states from 1849 to 1867 amounted to $ 1,174,000,000 , while for the same period the net exports of specie were $ 741,000,000 .
this shows an excess of product over net exports of $ 433,000,000 .
there are in the treasury $ 103,407,985 in coin ; in circulation in the states on the pacific coast about $ 40,000,000 , and a few millions in the national and other banks -- in all less than $ 160,000,000 .
taking into consideration the specie in the country prior to 1849 and that produced since 1867 , and we have more than $ 300,000,000 not accounted for by exportation or by returns of the treasury , and therefore most probably remaining in the country .
these are important facts , and show how completely the inferior currency will supersede the better , forcing it from circulation among the masses and causing it to be exported as a mere article of trade , to add to the money capital of foreign lands .
they show the necessity of retiring our paper money , that the return of gold and silver to the avenues of trade may be invited and a demand created which will cause the retention at home of at least so much of the productions of our rich and inexhaustible gold - bearing fields as may be sufficient for purposes of circulation .
it is unreasonable to expect a return to a sound currency so long as the government and banks , by continuing to issue irredeemable notes , fill the channels of circulation with depreciated paper .
notwithstanding a coinage by our mints since 1849 of $ 874,000,000 , the people are now strangers to the currency which was designed for their use and benefit , and specimens of the precious metals bearing the national device are seldom seen , except when produced to gratify the interest excited by their novelty .
if depreciated paper is to be continued as the permanent currency of the country , and all our coin is to become a mere article of traffic and speculation , to the enhancement in price of all that is indispensable to the comfort of the people , it would be wise economy to abolish our mints , thus saving the nation the care and expense incident to such establishments , and let our precious metals be exported in bullion .
the time has come , however , when the government and national banks should be required to take the most efficient steps and make all necessary arrangements for a resumption of specie payments .
let specie payments once be earnestly inaugurated by the government and banks , and the value of the paper circulation would directly approximate a specie standard .
specie payments having been resumed by the government and banks , all notes or bills of paper issued by either of a less denomination than $ 20 should by law be excluded from circulation , so that the people may have the benefit and convenience of a gold and silver currency which in all their business transactions will be uniform in value at home and abroad .
" every man of property or industry , every man who desires to preserve what he honestly possesses or to obtain what he can honestly earn , has a direct interest in maintaining a safe circulating medium -- such a medium as shall be real and substantial , not liable to vibrate with opinions , not subject to be blown up or blown down by the breath of speculation , but to be made stable and secure .
a disordered currency is one of the greatest political evils .
it undermines the virtues necessary for the support of the social system and encourages propensities destructive of its happiness ; it wars against industry , frugality , and economy , and it fosters the evil spirits of extravagance and speculation . "
it has been asserted by one of our profound and most gifted statesmen that-- 
 " of all the contrivances for cheating the laboring classes of mankind , none has been more effectual than that which deludes them with paper money .
this is the most effectual of inventions to fertilize the rich man 's fields by the sweat of the poor man 's brow .
ordinary tyranny , oppression , excessive taxation -- these bear lightly on the happiness of the mass of the community compared with a fraudulent currency and the robberies committed by depreciated paper .
our own history has recorded for our instruction enough , and more than enough , of the demoralizing tendency , the injustice , and the intolerable oppression on the virtuous and well - disposed of a degraded paper currency authorized by law or in any way countenanced by government . "
it is one of the most successful devices , in times of peace or war , of expansions or revulsions , to accomplish the transfer of all the precious metals from the great mass of the people into the hands of the few , where they are hoarded in secret places or deposited under bolts and bars , while the people are left to endure all the inconvenience , sacrifice , and demoralization resulting from the use of depreciated and worthless paper .
the secretary of the interior in his report gives valuable information in reference to the interests confided to the supervision of his department , and reviews the operations of the land office , pension office , patent office , and indian bureau .
during the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1868 , 6,655,700 acres of public land were disposed of .
the entire cash receipts of the general land office for the same period were $ 1,632,745 , being greater by $ 284,883 than the amount realized from the same sources during the previous year .
the entries under the homestead law cover 2,328,923 acres , nearly one - fourth of which was taken under the act of june 21 , 1866 , which applies only to the states of alabama , mississippi , louisiana , arkansas , and florida .
on the 30th of june , 1868 , 169,643 names were borne on the pension rolls , and during the year ending on that day the total amount paid for pensions , including the expenses of disbursement , was $ 24,010,982 , being $ 5,391,025 greater than that expended for like purposes during the preceding year .
during the year ending the 30th of september last the expenses of the patent office exceeded the receipts by $ 171 , and , including reissues and designs , 14,153 patents were issued .
treaties with various indian tribes have been concluded , and will be submitted to the senate for its constitutional action .
i cordially sanction the stipulations which provide for reserving lands for the various tribes , where they may be encouraged to abandon their nomadic habits and engage in agricultural and industrial pursuits .
this policy , inaugurated many years since , has met with signal success whenever it has been pursued in good faith and with becoming liberality by the united states .
the necessity for extending it as far as practicable in our relations with the aboriginal population is greater now than at any preceding period .
whilst we furnish subsistence and instruction to the indians and guarantee the undisturbed enjoyment of their treaty rights , we should habitually insist upon the faithful observance of their agreement to remain within their respective reservations .
this is the only mode by which collisions with other tribes and with the whites can be avoided and the safety of our frontier settlements secured .
the companies constructing the railway from omaha to sacramento have been most energetically engaged in prosecuting the work , and it is believed that the line will be completed before the expiration of the next fiscal year .
the 6 per cent bonds issued to these companies amounted on the 5th instant to $ 44,337,000 , and additional work had been performed to the extent of $ 3,200,000 .
the secretary of the interior in august last invited my attention to the report of a government director of the union pacific railroad company who had been specially instructed to examine the location , construction , and equipment of their road .
i submitted for the opinion of the attorney - general certain questions in regard to the authority of the executive which arose upon this report and those which had from time to time been presented by the commissioners appointed to inspect each successive section of the work .
after carefully considering the law of the case , he affirmed the right of the executive to order , if necessary , a thorough revision of the entire road .
commissioners were thereupon appointed to examine this and other lines , and have recently submitted a statement of their investigations , of which the report of the secretary of the interior furnishes specific information .
the report of the secretary of war contains information of interest and importance respecting the several bureaus of the war department and the operations of the army .
the strength of our military force on the 30th of september last was 48,000 men , and it is computed that by the 1st of january next this number will be decreased to 43,000 .
it is the opinion of the secretary of war that within the next year a considerable diminution of the infantry force may be made without detriment to the interests of the country ; and in view of the great expense attending the military peace establishment and the absolute necessity of retrenchment wherever it can be applied , it is hoped that congress will sanction the reduction which his report recommends .
while in 1860 sixteen thousand three hundred men cost the nation $ 16,472,000 , the sum of $ 65,682,000 is estimated as necessary for the support of the army during the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1870 .
the estimates of the war department for the last two fiscal years were , for 1867 , $ 33,814,461 , and for 1868 $ 25,205,669 .
the actual expenditures during the same periods were , respectively , $ 95,224,415 and $ 123,246,648 .
the estimate submitted in december last for the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1869 , was $ 77,124,707 ; the expenditures for the first quarter , ending the 30th of september last , were $ 27,219,117 , and the secretary of the treasury gives $ 66,000,000 as the amount which will probably be required during the remaining three quarters , if there should be no reduction of the army -- making its aggregate cost for the year considerably in excess of ninety - three millions .
the difference between the estimates and expenditures for the three fiscal years which have been named is thus shown to be $ 175,545,343 for this single branch of the public service .
the report of the secretary of the navy exhibits the operations of that department and of the navy during the year .
a considerable reduction of the force has been effected .
there are 42 vessels , carrying 411 guns , in the six squadrons which are established in different parts of the world .
three of these vessels are returning to the united states and 4 are used as storeships , leaving the actual cruising force 35 vessels , carrying 356 guns .
the total number of vessels in the navy is 206 , mounting 1,743 guns .
eighty - one vessels of every description are in use , armed with 696 guns .
the number of enlisted men in the service , including apprentices , has been reduced to 8,500 .
an increase of navy - yard facilities is recommended as a measure which will in the event of war be promotive of economy and security .
a more thorough and systematic survey of the north pacific ocean is advised in view of our recent acquisitions , our expanding commerce , and the increasing intercourse between the pacific states and asia .
the naval pension fund , which consists of a moiety of the avails of prizes captured during the war , amounts to $ 14,000,000 .
exception is taken to the act of 23d july last , which reduces the interest on the fund loaned to the government by the secretary , as trustee , to 3 per cent instead of 6 per cent , which was originally stipulated when the investment was made .
an amendment of the pension laws is suggested to remedy omissions and defects in existing enactments .
the expenditures of the department during the last fiscal year were $ 20,120,394 , and the estimates for the coming year amount to $ 20,993,414 .
the postmaster - general 's report furnishes a full and clear exhibit of the operations and condition of the postal service .
the ordinary postal revenue for the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1868 , was $ 16,292,600 , and the total expenditures , embracing all the service for which special appropriations have been made by congress , amounted to $ 22,730,592 , showing an excess of expenditures of $ 6,437,991 .
deducting from the expenditures the sum of $ 1,896,525 , the amount of appropriations for ocean - steamship and other special service , the excess of expenditures was $ 4,541,466 .
by using an unexpended balance in the treasury of $ 3,800,000 the actual sum for which a special appropriation is required to meet the deficiency is $ 741,466 .
the causes which produced this large excess of expenditure over revenue were the restoration of service in the late insurgent states and the putting into operation of new service established by acts of congress , which amounted within the last two years and a half to about 48,700 miles -- equal to more than one - third of the whole amount of the service at the close of the war .
new postal conventions with great britain , north germany , belgium , the netherlands , switzerland , and italy , respectively , have been carried into effect .
under their provisions important improvements have resulted in reduced rates of international postage and enlarged mail facilities with european countries .
the cost of the united states transatlantic ocean mail service since january 1 , 1868 , has been largely lessened under the operation of these new conventions , a reduction of over one - half having been effected under the new arrangements for ocean mail steamship service which went into effect on that date .
the attention of congress is invited to the practical suggestions and recommendations made in his report by the postmaster - general .
no important question has occurred during the last year in our accustomed cordial and friendly intercourse with costa rica , guatemala , honduras , san salvador , france , austria , belgium , switzerland , portugal , the netherlands , denmark , sweden and norway , rome , greece , turkey , persia , egypt , liberia , morocco , tripoli , tunis , muscat , siam , borneo , and madagascar .
cordial relations have also been maintained with the argentine and the oriental republics .
the expressed wish of congress that our national good offices might be tendered to those republics , and also to brazil and paraguay , for bringing to an end the calamitous war which has so long been raging in the valley of the la plata , has been assiduously complied with and kindly acknowledged by all the belligerents .
that important negotiation , however , has thus far been without result .
charles a. washburn , late united states minister to paraguay , having resigned , and being desirous to return to the united states , the rear - admiral commanding the south atlantic squadron was early directed to send a ship of war to asuncion , the capital of paraguay , to receive mr. washburn and his family and remove them from a situation which was represented to be endangered by faction and foreign war .
the brazilian commander of the allied invading forces refused permission to the wasp to pass through the blockading forces , and that vessel returned to its accustomed anchorage .
remonstrance having been made against this refusal , it was promptly overruled , and the wasp therefore resumed her errand , received mr. washburn and his family , and conveyed them to a safe and convenient seaport .
in the meantime an excited controversy had arisen between the president of paraguay and the late united states minister , which , it is understood , grew out of his proceedings in giving asylum in the united states legation to alleged enemies of that republic .
the question of the right to give asylum is one always difficult and often productive of great embarrassment .
in states well organized and established , foreign powers refuse either to concede or exercise that right , except as to persons actually belonging to the diplomatic service .
on the other hand , all such powers insist upon exercising the right of asylum in states where the law of nations is not fully acknowledged , respected .
and obeyed .
the president of paraguay is understood to have opposed to mr. washburn 's proceedings the injurious and very improbable charge of personal complicity in insurrection and treason .
the correspondence , however , has not yet reached the united states .
mr. washburn , in connection with this controversy , represents that two united states citizens attached to the legation were arbitrarily seized at his side , when leaving the capital of paraguay , committed to prison , and there subjected to torture for the purpose of procuring confessions of their own criminality and testimony to support the president ' s allegations against the united states minister .
mr. mcmahon , the newly appointed minister to paraguay , having reached the la plata , has been instructed to proceed without delay to asuncion , there to investigate the whole subject .
the rear - admiral commanding the united states south atlantic squadron has been directed to attend the new minister with a proper naval force to sustain such just demands as the occasion may require , and to vindicate the rights of the united states citizens referred to and of any others who may be exposed to danger in the theater of war .
with these exceptions , friendly relations have been maintained between the united states and brazil and paraguay .
our relations during the past year with bolivia , ecuador , peru , and chile have become especially friendly and cordial .
spain and the republics of peru , bolivia , and ecuador have expressed their willingness to accept the mediation of the united states for terminating the war upon the south pacific coast .
chile has not finally declared upon the question .
in the meantime the conflict has practically exhausted itself , since no belligerent or hostile movement has been made by either party during the last two years , and there are no indications of a present purpose to resume hostilities on either side .
great britain and france have cordially seconded our proposition of mediation , and i do not forego the hope that it may soon be accepted by all the belligerents and lead to a secure establishment of peace and friendly relations between the spanish american republics of the pacific and spain -- a result which would be attended with common benefits to the belligerents and much advantage to all commercial nations .
i communicate , for the consideration of congress , a correspondence which shows that the bolivian republic has established the extremely liberal principle of receiving into its citizenship any citizen of the united states , or of any other of the american republics , upon the simple condition of voluntary registry .
the correspondence herewith submitted will be found painfully replete with accounts of the ruin and wretchedness produced by recent earthquakes , of unparalleled severity , in the republics of peru , ecuador , and bolivia .
the diplomatic agents and naval officers of the united states who were present in those countries at the time of those disasters furnished all the relief in their power to the sufferers , and were promptly rewarded with grateful and touching acknowledgments by the congress of peru .
an appeal to the charity of our fellow - citizens has been answered by much liberality .
in this connection i submit an appeal which has been made by the swiss republic , whose government and institutions are kindred to our own , in behalf of its inhabitants , who are suffering extreme destitution , produced by recent devastating inundations .
our relations with mexico during the year have been marked by an increasing growth of mutual confidence .
the mexican government has not yet acted upon the three treaties celebrated here last summer for establishing the rights of naturalized citizens upon a liberal and just basis , for regulating consular powers , and for the adjustment of mutual claims .
all commercial nations , as well as all friends of republican institutions , have occasion to regret the frequent local disturbances which occur in some of the constituent states of colombia .
nothing has occurred , however , to affect the harmony and cordial friendship which have for several years existed between that youthful and vigorous republic and our own .
negotiations are pending with a view to the survey and construction of a ship canal across the isthmus of darien , under the auspices of the united states .
i hope to be able to submit the results of that negotiation to the senate during its present session .
the very liberal treaty which was entered into last year by the united states and nicaragua has been ratified by the latter republic .
costa rica , with the earnestness of a sincerely friendly neighbor , solicits a reciprocity of trade , which i commend to the consideration of congress .
the convention created by treaty between the united states and venezuela in july , 1865 , for the mutual adjustment of claims , has been held , and its decisions have been received at the department of state .
the heretofore - recognized government of the united states of venezuela has been subverted .
a provisional government having been instituted under circumstances which promise durability , it has been formally recognized .
i have been reluctantly obliged to ask explanation and satisfaction for national injuries committed by the president of hayti .
the political and social condition of the republics of hayti and st. domingo is very unsatisfactory and painful .
the abolition of slavery , which has been carried into effect throughout the island of st. domingo and the entire west indies , except the spanish islands of cuba and porto rico , has been followed by a profound popular conviction of the rightfulness of republican institutions and an intense desire to secure them .
the attempt , however , to establish republics there encounters many obstacles , most of which may be supposed to result from long - indulged habits of colonial supineness and dependence upon european monarchical powers .
while the united states have on all occasions professed a decided unwillingness that any part of this continent or of its adjacent islands shall be made a theater for a new establishment of monarchical power , too little has been done by us , on the other hand , to attach the communities by which we are surrounded to our own country , or to lend even a moral support to the efforts they are so resolutely and so constantly making to secure republican institutions for themselves .
it is indeed a question of grave consideration whether our recent and present example is not calculated to check the growth and expansion of free principles , and make those communities distrust , if not dread , a government which at will consigns to military domination states that are integral parts of our federal union , and , while ready to resist any attempts by other nations to extend to this hemisphere the monarchical institutions of europe , assumes to establish over a large portion of its people a rule more absolute , harsh , and tyrannical than any known to civilized powers .
the acquisition of alaska was made with the view of extending national jurisdiction and republican principles in the american hemisphere .
believing that a further step could be taken in the same direction , i last year entered into a treaty with the king of denmark for the purchase of the islands of st. thomas and st. john , on the best terms then attainable , and with the express consent of the people of those islands .
this treaty still remains under consideration in the senate .
a new convention has been entered into with denmark , enlarging the time fixed for final ratification of the original treaty .
comprehensive national policy would seem to sanction the acquisition and incorporation into our federal union of the several adjacent continental and insular communities as speedily as it can be done peacefully , lawfully , and without any violation of national justice , faith , or honor .
foreign possession or control of those communities has hitherto hindered the growth and impaired the influence of the united states .
chronic revolution and anarchy there would be equally injurious .
each one of them , when firmly established as an independent republic , or when incorporated into the united states , would be a new source of strength and power .
conforming my administration to these principles , i have or no occasion lent support or toleration to unlawful expeditions set on foot upon the plea of republican propagandism or of national extension or aggrandizement .
the necessity , however , of repressing such unlawful movements clearly indicates the duty which rests upon us of adapting our legislative action to the new circumstances of a decline of european monarchical power and influence and the increase of american republican ideas , interests , and sympathies .
it can not be long before it will become necessary for this government to lend some effective aid to the solution of the political and social problems which are continually kept before the world by the two republics of the island of st. domingo , and which are now disclosing themselves more distinctly than heretofore in the island of cuba .
the subject is commended to your consideration with all the more earnestness because i am satisfied that the time has arrived when even so direct a proceeding as a proposition for an annexation of the two republics of the island of st. domingo would not only receive the consent of the people interested , but would also give satisfaction to all other foreign nations .
i am aware that upon the question of further extending our possessions it is apprehended by some that our political system can not successfully be applied to an area more extended than our continent ; but the conviction is rapidly gaining ground in the american mind that with the increased facilities for intercommunication between all portions of the earth the principles of free government , as embraced in our constitution , if faithfully maintained and carried out , would prove of sufficient strength and breadth to comprehend within their sphere and influence the civilized nations of the world .
the attention of the senate and of congress is again respectfully invited to the treaty for the establishment of commercial reciprocity with the hawaiian kingdom entered into last year , and already ratified by that government .
the attitude of the united states toward these islands is not very different from that in which they stand toward the west indies .
it is known and felt by the hawaiian government and people that their government and institutions are feeble and precarious ; that the united states , being so near a neighbor , would be unwilling to see the islands pass under foreign control .
their prosperity is continually disturbed by expectations and alarms of unfriendly political proceedings , as well from the united states as from other foreign powers .
a reciprocity treaty , while it could not materially diminish the revenues of the united states , would be a guaranty of the good will and forbearance of all nations until the people of the islands shall of themselves , at no distant day , voluntarily apply for admission into the union .
the emperor of russia has acceded to the treaty negotiated here in january last for the security of trade - marks in the interest of manufacturers and commerce .
i have invited his attention to the importance of establishing , now while it seems easy and practicable , a fair and equal regulation of the vast fisheries belonging to the two nations in the waters of the north pacific ocean .
the two treaties between the united states and italy for the regulation of consular powers and the extradition of criminals , negotiated and ratified here during the last session of congress , have been accepted and confirmed by the italian government .
a liberal consular convention which has been negotiated with belgium will be submitted to the senate .
the very important treaties which were negotiated between the united states and north germany and bavaria for the regulation of the rights of naturalized citizens have been duly ratified and exchanged , and similar treaties have been entered into with the kingdoms of belgium and wurtemberg and with the grand duchies of baden and hesse - darmstadt .
i hope soon to be able to submit equally satisfactory conventions of the same character now in the course of negotiation with the respective governments of spain , italy , and the ottoman empire .
examination of claims against the united states by the hudsons bay company and the puget sound agricultural company , on account of certain possessory rights in the state of oregon and territory of washington , alleged by those companies in virtue of provisions of the treaty between the united states and great britain of june 15 , 1846 , has been diligently prosecuted , under the direction of the joint international commission to which they were submitted for adjudication by treaty between the two governments of july 1 , 1863 , and will , it is expected , be concluded at an early day .
no practical regulation concerning colonial trade and the fisheries can be accomplished by treaty between the united states and great britain until congress shall have expressed their judgment concerning the principles involved .
three other questions , however , between the united states and great britain remain open for adjustment .
these are the mutual rights of naturalized citizens , the boundary question involving the title to the island of san juan , on the pacific coast , and mutual claims arising since the year 1853 of the citizens and subjects of the two countries for injuries and depredations committed under the authority of their respective governments .
negotiations upon these subjects are pending , and i am not without hope of being able to lay before the senate , for its consideration during the present session , protocols calculated to bring to an end these justly exciting and long - existing controversies .
we are not advised of the action of the chinese government upon the liberal and auspicious treaty which was recently celebrated with its plenipotentiaries at this capital .
japan remains a theater of civil war , marked by religious incidents and political severities peculiar to that long - isolated empire .
the executive has hitherto maintained strict neutrality among the belligerents , and acknowledges with pleasure that it has been frankly and fully sustained in that course by the enlightened concurrence and cooperation of the other treaty powers , namely great britain , france , the netherlands , north germany , and italy .
spain having recently undergone a revolution marked by extraordinary unanimity and preservation of order , the provisional government established at madrid has been recognized , and the friendly intercourse which has so long happily existed between the two countries remains unchanged .
i renew the recommendation contained in my communication to congress dated the 18th july last -- a copy of which accompanies this message that the judgment of the people should be taken on the propriety of so amending the federal constitution that it shall provide-- 
 first .
for an election of president and vice - president by a direct vote of the people , instead of through the agency of electors , and making them ineligible for reelection to a second term .
second .
for a distinct designation of the person who shall discharge the duties of president in the event of a vacancy in that office by the death , resignation , or removal of both the president and vice - president .
third .
for the election of senators of the united states directly by the people of the several states , instead of by the legislatures ; and 
 fourth .
for the limitation to a period of years of the terms of federal judges .
profoundly impressed with the propriety of making these important modifications in the constitution , i respectfully submit them for the early and mature consideration of congress .
we should , as far as possible , remove all pretext for violations of the organic law , by remedying such imperfections as time and experience may develop , ever remembering that " the constitution which at any time exists until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all . "
in the performance of a duty imposed upon me by the constitution , i have thus communicated to congress information of the state of the union and recommended for their consideration such measures as have seemed to me necessary and expedient .
if carried into effect , they will hasten the accomplishment of the great and beneficent purposes for which the constitution was ordained , and which it comprehensively states were " to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . "
in congress are vested all legislative powers , and upon them devolves the responsibility as well for framing unwise and excessive laws as for neglecting to devise and adopt measures absolutely demanded by the wants of the country .
let us earnestly hope that before the expiration of our respective terms of service , now rapidly drawing to a close , an all - wise providence will so guide our counsels as to strengthen and preserve the federal unions , inspire reverence for the constitution , restore prosperity and happiness to our whole people , and promote " on earth peace , good will toward men . "

to the house of representatives : 
 i return without my signature a bill entitled " an act to admit the state of arkansas to representation in congress . "
the approval of this bill would be an admission on the part of the executive that the " act for the more efficient government of the rebel states , " passed march 2 , 1867 , and the acts supplementary thereto were proper and constitutional .
my opinion , however , in reference to those measures has undergone no change , but , on the contrary , has been strengthened by the results which have attended their execution .
even were this not the case , i could not consent to a bill which is based upon the assumption either that by an act of rebellion of a portion of its people the state of arkansas seceded from the union , or that congress may at its pleasure expel or exclude a state from the union , or interrupt its relations with the government by arbitrarily depriving it of representation in the senate and house of representatives .
if arkansas is a state not in the union , this bill does not admit it as a state into the union .
if , on the other hand , arkansas is a state in the union , no legislation is necessary to declare it entitled " to representation in congress as one of the states of the union . "
the constitution already declares that " each state shall have at least one representative ; " that the senate " shall be composed of two senators from each state , " and " that no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate . "
that instrument also makes each house " the judge of the elections , returns , and qualifications of its own members , " and therefore all that is now necessary to restore arkansas in all its constitutional relations to the government is a decision by each house upon the eligibility of those who , presenting their credentials , claim seats in the respective houses of congress .
this is the plain and simple plan of the constitution ; and believing that had it been pursued when congress assembled in the month of december , 1865 , the restoration of the states would long since have been completed , i once again earnestly recommend that it be adopted by each house in preference to legislation , which i respectfully submit is not only of at least doubtful constitutionality , and therefore unwise and dangerous as a precedent , but is unnecessary , not so effective in its operation as the mode prescribed by the constitution , involves additional delay , and from its terms may be taken rather as applicable to a territory about to be admitted as one of the united states than to a state which has occupied a place in the union for upward of a quarter of a century .
the bill declares the state of arkansas entitled and admitted to representation in congress as one of the states of the union upon the following fundamental condition : 
 that the constitution of arkansas shall never be so amended or changed as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the united states of the right to vote who are entitled to vote by the constitution herein recognized , except as a punishment for such crimes as are now felonies at common law , whereof they shall have been duly convicted under laws equally applicable to all the inhabitants of said state .
provided , that any alteration of said constitution , prospective in its effect , may be made in regard to the time and place of residence of voters .
i have been unable to find in the constitution of the united states any warrant for the exercise of the authority thus claimed by congress .
in assuming the power to impose a " fundamental condition " upon a state which has been duly " admitted into the union upon an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatever , " congress asserts a right to enter a state as it may a territory , and to regulate the highest prerogative of a free people the elective franchise .
this question is reserved by the constitution to the states themselves , and to concede to congress the power to regulate the subject would be to reverse the fundamental principle of the republic and to place in the hands of the federal government , which is the creature of the states , the sovereignty which justly belongs to the states or the people -- the true source of all political power , by whom our federal system was created and to whose will it is subordinate .
the bill fails to provide in what manner the state of arkansas is to signify its acceptance of the " fundamental condition " which congress endeavors to make unalterable and irrevocable .
nor does it prescribe the penalty to be imposed should the people of the state amend or change the particular portions of the constitution which it is one of the purposes of the bill to perpetuate , but as to the consequences of such action leaves them in uncertainty and doubt .
when the circumstances under which this constitution has been brought to the attention of congress are considered , it is not unreasonable to suppose that efforts will be made to modify its provisions , and especially those in respect to which this measure prohibits any alteration .
it is seriously questioned whether the constitution has been ratified by a majority of the persons who , under the act of march 2 , 1867 , and the acts supplementary thereto , were entitled to registration and to vote upon that issue .
section 10 of the schedule provides that-- 
 no person disqualified from voting or registering under this constitution shall vote for candidates for any office , nor shall be permitted to vote for the ratification or rejection of the constitution at the polls herein authorized .
assumed to be in force before its adoption , in disregard of the law of congress , the constitution undertakes to impose upon the elector other and further conditions .
the fifth section of the eighth article provides that " all persons , before registering or voting , " must take and subscribe an oath which , among others , contains the following clause : 
 that i accept the civil and political equality of all men , and agree not to attempt to deprive any person or persons , on account of race , color , or previous condition , of any political or civil right , privilege , or immunity enjoyed by any other class of men .
it is well known that a very large portion of the electors in all the states , if not a large majority of all of them , do not believe in or accept the political equality of indians , mongolians , or negroes with the race to which they belong .
if the voters in many of the states of the north and west were required to take such an oath as a test of their qualification , there is reason to believe that a majority of them would remain from the polls rather than comply with its degrading conditions .
how far and to what extent this test oath prevented the registration of those who were qualified under the laws of congress it is not possible to know , but that such was its effect , at least sufficient to overcome the small and doubtful majority in favor of this constitution , there can be no reasonable doubt .
should the people of arkansas , therefore , desiring to regulate the elective franchise so as to make it conform to the constitutions of a large proportion of the states of the north and west , modify the provisions referred to in the " fundamental condition , " what is to be the consequence ?
is it intended that a denial of representation shall follow ?
and if so , may we not dread , at some future day , a recurrence of the troubles which have so long agitated the country ?
would it not be the part of wisdom to take for our guide the federal constitution , rather than resort to measures which , looking only to the present , may in a few years renew , in an aggravated form , the strife and bitterness caused by legislation which has proved to be so ill timed and unfortunate ?

gentlemen : i must be permitted to say that i have been almost overwhelmed by the announcement of the sad event which has so recently occurred .
i feel incompetent to perform duties so important and responsible as those which have been so unexpectedly thrown upon me .
as to an indication of any policy which may be pursued by me in the administration of the government , i have to say that that must be left for development as the administration progresses .
the message or declaration must be made by the acts as they transpire .
the only assurance that i can now give of the future is reference to the past .
the course which i have taken in the past in connection with this rebellion must be regarded as a guaranty of the future .
my past public life , which has been long and laborious , has been founded , as i in good conscience believe , upon a great principle of right , which lies at the basis of all things .
the best energies of my life have been spent in endeavoring to establish and perpetuate the principles of free government , and i believe that the government in passing through its present perils will settle down upon principles consonant with popular rights more permanent and enduring than heretofore .
i must be permitted to say , if i understand the feelings of my own heart , that i have long labored to ameliorate and elevate the condition of the great mass of the american people .
toil and an honest advocacy of the great principles of free government have been my lot .
duties have been mine ; consequences are god 's .
this has been the foundation of my political creed , and i feel that in the end the government will triumph and that these great principles will be permanently established .
in conclusion , gentlemen , let me say that i want your encouragement and countenance .
i shall ask and rely upon you and others in carrying the government through its present perils .
i feel in making this request that it will be heartily responded to by you and all other patriots and lovers of the rights and interests of a free people .

war department , 
 adjutant - general 's office 
 whereas several commanders of military districts created by the acts of congress known as the reconstruction acts have expressed doubts as to the proper construction thereof and in respect to some of their powers and duties under said acts , and have applied to the executive for information in relation thereto ; and 
 whereas the said acts of congress have been referred to the attorney - general for his opinion thereon , and the said acts and the opinion of the attorney - general have been fully and carefully considered by the president in conference with the heads of the respective departments : 
 the president accepts the following as a practical interpretation of the aforesaid acts of congress on the points therein presented , and directs the same to be transmitted to the respective military commanders for their information , in order that there may be uniformity in the execution of said acts : 
 1 .
the oath prescribed in the supplemental act defines all the qualifications required , and every person who can take that oath is entitled to have his name entered upon the list of voters .
2 .
the board of registration have no authority to administer any other oath to the person applying for registration than this prescribed oath , nor to administer an oath to any other person touching the qualifications of the applicant or the falsity of the oath so taken by him .
the act , to guard against falsity in the oath , provides that if false the person taking it shall be tried and punished for perjury .
no provision is made for challenging the qualifications of the applicant or entering upon any trial or investigation of his qualifications , either by witnesses or any other form of proof .
3 .
as to citizenship and residence : 
 the applicant for registration must be a citizen of the state and of the united states , and must be a resident of a county or parish included in the election district .
he may be registered if he has been such citizen for a period less than twelve months at the time he applies for registration , but he can not vote at any election unless his citizenship has then extended to the full term of one year .
as to such a person , the exact length of his citizenship should be noted opposite his name on the list , so that it may appear on the day of election , upon reference to the list , whether the full term has then been accomplished .
4 .
an unnaturalized person can not take this oath , but an alien who has been naturalized can take it , and no other proof of naturalization can be required from him .
5 .
no one who is not 21 years of age at the time of registration can take the oath , for he must swear that he has then attained that age .
6 .
no one who has been disfranchised for participation in any rebellion against the united states or for felony committed against the laws of any state or of the united states can take this oath .
the actual participation in a rebellion or the actual commission of a felony does not amount to disfranchisement .
the sort of disfranchisement here meant is that which is declared by law passed by competent authority , or which has been fixed upon the criminal by the sentence of the court which tried him for the crime .
no law of the united states has declared the penalty of disfranchisement for participation in rebellion alone ; nor is it known that any such law exists in either of these ten states , except , perhaps , virginia , as to which state special instructions will be given .
7 .
as to disfranchisement arising from having held office followed by participation in rebellion : 
 this is the most important part of the oath , and requires strict attention to arrive at its meaning .
the applicant must swear or affirm as follows : 
 that i have never been a member of any state legislature , nor held any executive or judicial office in any state , and afterwards engaged in an insurrection or rebellion against the united states or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof ; that i have never taken an oath as a member of congress of the united states , or as an officer of the united states , or as a member of any state legislature , or as an executive or judicial officer of any state , to support the constitution of the united states , and afterwards engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the united states or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof .
two elements must concur in order to disqualify a person under these clauses : first , the office and official oath to support the constitution of the united states ; second , engaging afterwards in rebellion .
both must exist to work disqualification , and must happen in the order of time mentioned .
a person who has held an office and taken the oath to support the federal constitution and has not afterwards engaged in rebellion is not disqualified .
so , too , a person who has engaged in rebellion , but has not theretofore held an office and taken that oath , is not disqualified .
8 .
officers of the united states : 
 as to these the language is without limitation .
the person who has at any time prior to the rebellion held an office , civil or military , under the united states , and has taken an official oath to support the constitution of the united states , is subject to disqualification .
9 .
militia officers of any state prior to the rebellion are not subject to disqualification .
10 .
municipal officers --that is to say , officers of incorporated cities , towns , and villages , such as mayors , aldermen , town council , police , and other city or town officers -- are not subject to disqualification .
11 .
persons who have prior to the rebellion been members of the congress of the united states or members of a state legislature are subject to disqualification , but those who have been members of conventions framing or amending the constitution of a state prior to the rebellion are not subject to disqualification .
12 .
all the executive or judicial officers of any state who took an oath to support the constitution of the united states are subject to disqualification , including county officers .
they are subject to disqualification if they were required to take as a part of their official oath the oath to support the constitution of the united states .
13 .
persons who exercised mere employment under state authority are not disqualified ; such as commissioners to lay out roads , commissioners of public works , visitors of state institutions , directors of state institutions , examiners of banks , notaries public , and commissioners to take acknowledgments of deeds .
engaging in rebellion .
having specified what offices held by anyone prior to the rebellion come within the meaning of the law , it is necessary next to set forth what subsequent conduct fixes upon such person the offense of engaging in rebellion .
two things must exist as to any person to disqualify him from voting : first , the office held prior to the rebellion , and , afterwards , participation in the rebellion .
14 .
an act to fix upon a person the offense of engaging in the rebellion under this law must be an overt and voluntary act , done with the intent of aiding or furthering the common unlawful purpose .
a person forced into the rebel service by conscription or under a paramount authority which he could not safely disobey , and who would not have entered such service if left to the free exercise of his own will , can not be held to be disqualified from voting .
15 .
mere acts of charity , where the intent is to relieve the wants of the object of such charity , and not done in aid of the cause in which he may have been engaged , do not disqualify ; but organized contributions of food and clothing for the general relief of persons engaged in the rebellion , and not of a merely sanitary character , but contributed to enable them to perform their unlawful object , may be classed with acts which do disqualify .
forced contributions to the rebel cause in the form of taxes or military assessments , which a person was compelled to pay or contribute , do not disqualify ; but voluntary contributions to the rebel cause .
even such indirect contributions as arise from the voluntary loan of money to rebel authorities or purchase of bonds or securities created to afford the means of carrying on the rebellion , will work disqualification .
16 .
all those who in legislative or other official capacity were engaged in the furtherance of the common unlawful purpose , where the duties of the office necessarily had relation to the support of the rebellion , such as members of the rebel conventions , congresses , and legislatures , diplomatic agents of the rebel confederacy , and other officials whose offices were created for the purpose of more effectually carrying on hostilities or whose duties appertained to the support of the rebel cause , must be held to be disqualified .
but officers who during the rebellion discharged official duties not incident to war , but only such duties as belong even to a state of peace and were necessary to the preservation of order and the administration of law , are not to be considered as thereby engaging in rebellion or as disqualified .
disloyal sentiments , opinions , or sympathies would not disqualify , but where a person has by speech or by writing incited others to engage in rebellion he must come under the disqualification .
17 .
the duties of the board appointed to superintend the elections : 
 this board , having the custody of the list of registered voters in the district for which it is constituted , must see that the name of the person offering to vote is found upon the registration list , and if such proves to be the fact it is the duty of the board to receive his vote if then qualified by residence .
they can not receive the vote of any person whose name is not upon the list , though he may be ready to take the registration oath , and although he may satisfy them that he was unable to have his name registered at the proper time , in consequence of absence , sickness , or other cause .
the board can not enter into any inquiry as to the qualifications of any person whose name is not on the registration list , or as to the qualifications of any person whose name is on the list .
18 .
the mode of voting is provided in the act to be by ballot .
the board will keep a record and poll book of the election , showing the votes , list of voters , and the persons elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the election , and make returns of these to the commanding general of the district .
19 .
the board appointed for registration and for superintending the elections must take the oath prescribed by the act of congress approved july 2 , 1862 , entitled " an act to prescribe an oath of office . "
by order of the president : 
 e. d. townsend , 
 assistant adjutant - general .

whereas the president of the united states , on the 8th day of december , a. d. 1863 , and on the 26th day of march , a. d. 1864 , did , with the object to suppress the existing rebellion , to induce all persons to return to their loyalty , and to restore the authority of the united states , issue proclamations offering amnesty and pardon to certain persons who had , directly or by implication , participated in the said rebellion ; and

andrew johnson .
by the president : 
 william h. seward , 
 secretary of state .

being desirous to relieve all loyal citizens and well - disposed persons residing in insurrectionary states from unnecessary commercial restrictions and to encourage them to return to peaceful pursuits-- 
 it is hereby ordered , i. that all restrictions upon internal , domestic , and coastwise commercial intercourse be discontinued in such parts of the states of tennessee , virginia , north carolina , south carolina , georgia , florida , alabama , mississippi , and so much of louisiana as lies east of the mississippi river as shall be embraced within the lines of national military occupation , excepting only such restrictions as are imposed by acts of congress and regulations in pursuance thereof prescribed by the secretary of the treasury and approved by the president , and excepting also from the effect of this order the following articles contraband of war , to wit : arms , ammunition , all articles from which ammunition is manufactured , gray uniforms and cloth , locomotives , cars , railroad iron , and machinery for operating railroads , telegraph wires , insulators , and instruments for operating telegraphic lines .
ii .
that all existing military and naval orders in any manner restricting internal , domestic , and coastwise commercial intercourse and trade with or in the localities above named be , and the same are hereby , revoked , and that no military or naval officer in any manner interrupt or interfere with the same , or with any boats or other vessels engaged therein under proper authority , pursuant to the regulations of the secretary of the treasury .

to the senate of the united states : 
 in reply to the resolution adopted by the senate on the 12th instant , i have the honor to state that the rebellion waged by a portion of the people against the properly constituted authority of the government of the united states has been suppressed ; that the united states are in possession of every state in which the insurrection existed , and that ; as far as it could be done , the courts of the united states have been restored , post - offices reestablished , and steps taken to put into effective operation the revenue laws of the country .
as the result of the measures instituted by the executive with the view of inducing a resumption of the functions of the states comprehended in the inquiry of the senate , the people of north carolina , south carolina , georgia , alabama , mississippi , louisiana , arkansas , and tennessee have reorganized their respective state governments , and " are yielding obedience to the laws and government of the united states " with more willingness and greater promptitude than under the circumstances could reasonably have been anticipated .
the proposed amendment to the constitution , providing for the abolition of slavery forever within the limits of the country , has been ratified by each one of those states , with the exception of mississippi , from which no official information has been received , and in nearly all of them measures have been adopted or are now pending to confer upon freedmen the privileges which are essential to their comfort , protection , and security .
in florida and texas the people are making commendable progress in restoring their state governments , and no doubt is entertained that they will at an early period be in a condition to resume all of their practical relations with the general government .
in " that portion of the union lately in rebellion " the aspect of affairs is more promising than , in view of all the circumstances could well have been expected .
the people throughout the entire south evince a laudable desire to renew their allegiance to the government and to repair the devastations of war by a prompt and cheerful return to peaceful pursuits , and abiding faith is entertained that their actions will conform to their professions , and that in acknowledging the supremacy of the constitution and laws of the united states their loyalty will be unreservedly given to the government , whose leniency they can not fail to appreciate and whose fostering care will soon restore them to a condition of prosperity .
it is true that in some of the states the demoralizing effects of the war are to be seen in occasional disorders ; but these are local in character , not frequent in occurrence , and are rapidly disappearing as the authority of civil law is extended and sustained .
perplexing questions are naturally to be expected from the great and sudden change in the relations between the two races ; but system are gradually developing themselves under which the freedman will receive the protection to which he is justly entitled , and , by means of his labor , make himself a useful and independent member in the community in which he has a home .
from all the information in my possession and from that which i have recently derived from the most reliable authority i am induced to cherish the belief that sectional animosity is surely and rapidly merging itself into a spirit of nationality , and that representation , connected with a properly adjusted system of taxation , will result in a harmonious restoration of the relation of the states to the national union .
the report of carl schurz is herewith transmitted , as requested by the senate .
no reports from the hon .
john coyode have been received by the president .
the attention of the senate is invited to the accompanying report from lieutenant - general grant , who recently made a tour of inspection through several of the states whose inhabitants participated in the rebellion .

fellow - citizens of the senate and house of representatives : 
 the continued disorganization of the union , to which the president has so often called the attention of congress , is yet a subject of profound and patriotic concern .
we may , however , find some relief from that anxiety in the reflection that the painful political situation , although before untried by ourselves , is not new in the experience of nations .
political science , perhaps as highly perfected in our own time and country as in any other , has not yet disclosed any means by which civil wars can be absolutely prevented .
an enlightened nation , however , with a wise and beneficent constitution of free government , may diminish their frequency and mitigate their severity by directing all its proceedings in accordance with its fundamental law .
when a civil war has been brought to a close , it is manifestly the first interest and duty of the state to repair the injuries which the war has inflicted , and to secure the benefit of the lessons it teaches as fully and as speedily as possible .
this duty was , upon the termination of the rebellion , promptly accepted not only by the executive department , but by the insurrectionary states themselves , and restoration in the first moment of peace was believed to be as easy and certain as it was indispensable .
the expectations , however , then so reasonably and confidently entertained were disappointed by legislation from which i felt constrained by my obligations to the constitution to withhold my assent .
it is therefore a source of profound regret that in complying with the obligation imposed upon the president by the constitution to give to congress from time to time information of the state of the union i am unable to communicate any definitive adjustment satisfactory to the american people , of the questions which since the close of the rebellion have agitated the public mind .
on the contrary , candor compels me to declare that at this time there is no union as our fathers understood the term , and as they meant it to be understood by us .
the union which they established can exist only where all the states are represented in both houses of congress ; where one state is as free as another to regulate its internal concerns according to its own will , and where the laws of the central government , strictly confined to matters of national jurisdiction , apply with equal force to all the people of every section .
that such is not the present " state of the union " is a melancholy fact , and we must all acknowledge that the restoration of the states to their proper legal relations with the federal government and with one another , according to the terms of the original compact , would be the greatest temporal blessing which god , in his kindest providence , could bestow upon this nation .
it becomes our imperative duty to consider whether or not it is impossible to effect this most desirable consummation .
the union and the constitution are inseparable .
as long as one is obeyed by all parties , the other will be preserved ; and if one is destroyed , both must perish together .
the destruction of the constitution will be followed by other and still greater calamities .
it was ordained not only to form a more perfect union between the states , but to " establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . "
nothing but implicit obedience to its requirements in all parts of the country will accomplish these great ends .
without that obedience we can look forward only to continual outrages upon individual rights , incessant breaches of the public peace , national weakness , financial dishonor , the total loss of our prosperity , the general corruption of morals , and the final extinction of popular freedom .
to save our country from evils so appalling as these , we should renew our efforts again and again .
to me the process of restoration seems perfectly plain and simple .
it consists merely in a faithful application of the constitution and laws .
the execution of the laws is not now obstructed or opposed by physical force .
there is no military or other necessity , real or pretended , which can prevent obedience to the constitution , either north or south .
all the rights and all the obligations of states and individuals can be protected and enforced by means perfectly consistent with the fundamental law .
the courts may be everywhere open , and if open their process would be unimpeded .
crimes against the united states can be prevented or punished by the proper judicial authorities in a manner entirely practicable and legal .
there is therefore no reason why the constitution should not be obeyed , unless those who exercise its powers have determined that it shall be disregarded and violated .
the mere naked will of this government , or of some one or more of its branches , is the only obstacle that can exist to a perfect union of all the states .
on this momentous question and some of the measures growing out of it i have had the misfortune to differ from congress , and have expressed my convictions without reserve , though with becoming deference to the opinion of the legislative department .
those convictions are not only unchanged , but strengthened by subsequent events and further reflection .
the transcendent importance of the subject will be a sufficient excuse for calling your attention to some of the reasons which have so strongly influenced my own judgment .
the hope that we may all finally concur in a mode of settlement consistent at once with our true interests and with our sworn duties to the constitution is too natural and too just to be easily relinquished .
it is clear to my apprehension that the states lately in rebellion are still members of the national union .
when did they cease to be so ?
the " ordinances of secession " adopted by a portion ( in most of them a very small portion ) of their citizens were mere nullities .
if we admit now that they were valid and effectual for the purpose intended by their authors , we sweep from under our feet the whole ground upon which we justified the war .
were those states afterwards expelled from the union by the war ?
the direct contrary was averred by this government to be its purpose , and was so understood by all those who gave their blood and treasure to aid in its prosecution .
it can not be that a successful war , waged for the preservation of the union , had the legal effect of dissolving it .
the victory of the nation 's arms was not the disgrace of her policy ; the defeat of secession on the battlefield was not the triumph of its lawless principle .
nor could congress , with or without the consent of the executive , do anything which would have the effect , directly or indirectly , of separating the states from each other .
to dissolve the union is to repeal the constitution which holds it together , and that is a power which does not belong to any department of this government , or to all of them united .
this is so plain that it has been acknowledged by all branches of the federal government .
the executive ( my predecessor as well as myself ) and the heads of all the departments have uniformly acted upon the principle that the union is not only undissolved , but indissoluble .
congress submitted an amendment of the constitution to be ratified by the southern states , and accepted their acts of ratification as a necessary and lawful exercise of their highest function .
if they were not states , or were states out of the union , their consent to a change in the fundamental law of the union would have been nugatory , and congress in asking it committed a political absurdity .
the judiciary has also given the solemn sanction of its authority to the same view of the case .
the judges of the supreme court have included the southern states in their circuits , and they are constantly , in banc and elsewhere , exercising jurisdiction which does not belong to them unless those states are states of the union .
if the southern states are component parts of the union , the constitution is the supreme law for them , as it is for all the other states .
they are bound to obey it , and so are we .
the right of the federal government , which is clear and unquestionable , to enforce the constitution upon them implies the correlative obligation on our part to observe its limitations and execute its guaranties .
without the constitution we are nothing ; by , through , and under the constitution we are what it makes us .
we may doubt the wisdom of the law , we may not approve of its provisions , but we can not violate it merely because it seems to confine our powers within limits narrower than we could wish .
it is not a question of individual or class or sectional interest , much less of party predominance , but of duty -- of high and sacred duty -- which we are all sworn to perform .
if we can not support the constitution with the cheerful alacrity of those who love and believe in it , we must give to it at least the fidelity of public servants who act under solemn obligations and commands which they dare not disregard .
the constitutional duty is not the only one which requires the states to be restored .
there is another consideration which , though of minor importance , is yet of great weight .
on the 22d day of july , 1861 , congress declared by an almost unanimous vote of both houses that the war should be conducted solely for the purpose of preserving the union and maintaining the supremacy of the federal constitution and laws , without impairing the dignity , equality , and rights of the states or of individuals , and that when this was done the war should cease .
i do not say that this declaration is personally binding on those who joined in making it , any more than individual members of congress are personally bound to pay a public debt created under a law for which they voted .
but it was a solemn , public , official pledge of the national honor , and i can not imagine upon what grounds the repudiation of it is to be justified .
if it be said that we are not bound to keep faith with rebels , let it be remembered that this promise was not made to rebels only .
thousands of true men in the south were drawn to our standard by it , and hundreds of thousands in the north gave their lives in the belief that it would be carried out .
it was made on the day after the first great battle of the war had been fought and lost .
all patriotic and intelligent men then saw the necessity of giving such an assurance , and believed that without it the war would end in disaster to our cause .
having given that assurance in the extremity of our peril , the violation of it now , in the day of our power , would be a rude rending of that good faith which holds the moral world together ; our country would cease to have any claim upon the confidence of men ; it would make the war not only a failure , but a fraud .
being sincerely convinced that these views are correct , i would be unfaithful to my duty if i did not recommend the repeal of the acts of congress which place ten of the southern states under the domination of military masters .
if calm reflection shall satisfy a majority of your honorable bodies that the acts referred to are not only a violation of the national faith , but in direct conflict with the constitution , i dare not permit myself to doubt that you will immediately strike them from the statute book .
to demonstrate the unconstitutional character of those acts i need do no more than refer to their general provisions .
it must be seen at once that they are not authorized .
to dictate what alterations shall be made in the constitutions of the several states ; to control the elections of state legislators and state officers , members of congress and electors of president and vice - president , by arbitrarily declaring who shall vote and who shall be excluded from that privilege ; to dissolve state legislatures or prevent them from assembling ; to dismiss judges and other civil functionaries of the state and appoint others without regard to state law ; to organize and operate all the political machinery of the states ; to regulate the whole administration of their domestic and local affairs according to the mere will of strange and irresponsible agents , sent among them for that purpose -- these are powers not granted to the federal government or to any one of its branches .
not being granted , we violate our trust by assuming them as palpably as we would by acting in the face of a positive interdict ; for the constitution forbids us to do whatever it does not affirmatively authorize , either by express words or by clear implication .
if the authority we desire to use does not come to us through the constitution , we can exercise it only by usurpation , and usurpation is the most dangerous of political crimes .
by that crime the enemies of free government in all ages have worked out their designs against public liberty and private right .
it leads directly and immediately to the establishment of absolute rule , for undelegated power is always unlimited and unrestrained .
the acts of congress in question are not only objectionable for their assumption of ungranted power , but many of their provisions are in conflict with the direct prohibitions of the constitution .
the constitution commands that a republican form of government shall be guaranteed to all the states ; that no person shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property without due process of law , arrested without a judicial warrant , or punished without a fair trial before an impartial jury ; that the privilege of habeas corpus shall not be denied in time of peace , and that no bill of attainder shall be passed even against a single individual .
yet the system of measures established by these acts of congress does totally subvert and destroy the form as well as the substance of republican government in the ten states to which they apply .
it binds them hand and foot in absolute slavery , and subjects them to a strange and hostile power , more unlimited and more likely to be abused than any other now known among civilized men .
it tramples down all those rights in which the essence of liberty consists , and which a free government is always most careful to protect .
it denies the habeas corpus and the trial by jury .
personal freedom , property , and life , if assailed by the passion , the prejudice , or the rapacity of the ruler , have no security whatever .
it has the effect of a bill of attainder or bill of pains and penalties , not upon a few individuals , but upon whole masses , including the millions who inhabit the subject states , and even their unborn children .
these wrongs , being expressly forbidden , can not be constitutionally inflicted upon any portion of our people , no matter how they may have come within our jurisdiction , and no matter whether they live in states , territories , or districts .
i have no desire to save from the proper and just consequences of their great crime those who engaged in rebellion against the government , but as a mode of punishment the measures under consideration are the most unreasonable that could be invented .
many of those people are perfectly innocent ; many kept their fidelity to the union untainted to the last ; many were incapable of any legal offense ; a large proportion even of the persons able to bear arms were forced into rebellion against their will , and of those who are guilty with their own consent the degrees of guilt are as various as the shades of their character and temper .
but these acts of congress confound them all together in one common doom .
indiscriminate vengeance upon classes , sects , and parties , or upon whole communities , for offenses committed by a portion of them against the governments to which they owed obedience was common in the barbarous ages of the world ; but christianity and civilization have made such progress that recourse to a punishment so cruel and unjust would meet with the condemnation of all unprejudiced and right - minded men .
the punitive justice of this age , and especially of this country , does not consist in stripping whole states of their liberties and reducing all their people , without distinction , to the condition of slavery .
it deals separately with each individual , confines itself to the forms of law , and vindicates its own purity by an impartial examination of every case before a competent judicial tribunal .
if this does not satisfy all our desires with regard to southern rebels , let us console ourselves by reflecting that a free constitution , triumphant in war and unbroken in peace , is worth far more to us and our children than the gratification of any present feeling .
i am aware it is assumed that this system of government for the southern states is not to be perpetual .
it is true this military government is to be only provisional , but it is through this temporary evil that a greater evil is to be made perpetual .
if the guaranties of the constitution can be broken provisionally to serve a temporary purpose , and in a part only of the country , we can destroy them everywhere and for all time .
arbitrary measures often change , but they generally change for the worse .
it is the curse of despotism that it has no halting place .
the intermitted exercise of its power brings no sense of security to its subjects , for they can never know what more they will be called to endure when its red right hand is armed to plague them again .
nor is it possible to conjecture how or where power , unrestrained by law , may seek its next victims .
the states that are still free may be enslaved at any moment ; for if the constitution does not protect all , it protects none .
it is manifestly and avowedly the object of these laws to confer upon negroes the privilege of voting and to disfranchise such a number of white citizens as will give the former a clear majority at all elections in the southern states .
this , to the minds of some persons , is so important that a violation of the constitution is justified as a means of bringing it about .
the morality is always false which excuses a wrong because it proposes to accomplish a desirable end .
we are not permitted to do evil that good may come .
but in this case the end itself is evil , as well as the means .
the subjugation of the states to negro domination would be worse than the military despotism under which they are now suffering .
it was believed beforehand that the people would endure any amount of military oppression for any length of time rather than degrade themselves by subjection to the negro race .
therefore they have been left without a choice .
negro suffrage was established by act of congress , and the military officers were commanded to superintend the process of clothing the negro race with the political privileges torn from white men .
the blacks in the south are entitled to be well and humanely governed , and to have the protection of just laws for all their rights of person and property .
if it were practicable at this time to give them a government exclusively their own , under which they might manage their own affairs in their own way , it would become a grave question whether we ought to do so , or whether common humanity would not require us to save them from themselves .
but under the circumstances this is only a speculative point .
it is not proposed merely that they shall govern themselves , but that they shall rule the white race , make and administer state laws , elect presidents and members of congress , and shape to a greater or less extent the future destiny of the whole country .
would such a trust and power be safe in such hands ?
the peculiar qualities which should characterize any people who are fit to decide upon the management of public affairs for a great state have seldom been combined .
it is the glory of white men to know that they have had these qualities in sufficient measure to build upon this continent a great political fabric and to preserve its stability for more than ninety years , while in every other part of the world all similar experiments have failed .
but if anything can be proved by known facts , if all reasoning upon evidence is not abandoned , it must be acknowledged that in the progress of nations negroes have shown less capacity for government than any other race of people .
no independent government of any form has ever been successful in their hands .
on the contrary , wherever they have been left to their own devices they have shown a constant tendency to relapse into barbarism .
in the southern states , however , congress has undertaken to confer upon them the privilege of the ballot .
just released from slavery , it may be doubted whether as a class they know more than their ancestors how to organize and regulate civil society .
indeed , it is admitted that the blacks of the south are not only regardless of the rights of property , but so utterly ignorant of public affairs that their voting can consist in nothing more than carrying a ballot to the place where they are directed to deposit it .
i need not remind you that the exercise of the elective franchise is the highest attribute of an american citizen , and that when guided by virtue , intelligence , patriotism , and a proper appreciation of our free institutions it constitutes the true basis of a democratic form of government , in which the sovereign power is lodged in the body of the people .
a trust artificially created , not for its own sake , but solely as a means of promoting the general welfare , its influence for good must necessarily depend upon the elevated character and true allegiance of the elector .
it ought , therefore , to be reposed in none except those who are fitted morally and mentally to administer it well ; for if conferred upon persons who do not justly estimate its value and who are indifferent as to its results , it will only serve as a means of placing power in the hands of the unprincipled and ambitious , and must eventuate in the complete destruction of that liberty of which it should be the most powerful conservator .
i have therefore heretofore urged upon your attention the great danger-- 
 to be apprehended from an untimely extension of the elective franchise to any new class in our country , especially when the large majority of that class , in wielding the power thus placed in their hands , can not be expected correctly to comprehend the duties and responsibilities which pertain to suffrage .
yesterday , as it were , 4,000,000 persons were held in a condition of slavery that had existed for generations ; to - day they are freemen and are assumed by law to be citizens .
it can not be presumed , from their previous condition of servitude , that as a class they are as well informed as to the nature of our government as the intelligent foreigner who makes our land the home of his choice .
in the case of the latter neither a residence of five years and the knowledge of our institutions which it gives nor attachment to the principles of the constitution are the only conditions upon which he can be admitted to citizenship ; he must prove in addition a good moral character , and thus give reasonable ground for the belief that he will be faithful to the obligations which he assumes as a citizen of the republic .
where a people -- the source of all political power -- speak by their suffrages through the instrumentality of the ballot box , it must be carefully guarded against the control of those who are corrupt in principle and enemies of free institutions , for it can only become to our political and social system a safe conductor of healthy popular sentiment when kept free from demoralizing influences .
controlled through fraud and usurpation by the designing , anarchy and despotism must inevitably follow .
in the hands of the patriotic and worthy our government will be preserved upon the principles of the constitution inherited from our fathers .
it follows , therefore , that in admitting to the ballot box a new class of voters not qualified for the exercise of the elective franchise we weaken our system of government instead of adding to its strength and durability .
i yield to no one in attachment to that rule of general suffrage which distinguishes our policy as a nation .
but there is a limit , wisely observed hitherto , which makes the ballot a privilege and a trust , and which requires of some classes a time suitable for probation and preparation .
to give it indiscriminately to a new class , wholly unprepared by previous habits and opportunities to perform the trust which it demands , is to degrade it , and finally to destroy its power , for it may be safely assumed that no political truth is better established than that such indiscriminate and all - embracing extension of popular suffrage must end at last in its destruction .
i repeat the expression of my willingness to join in any plan within the scope of our constitutional authority which promises to better the condition of the negroes in the south , by encouraging them in industry , enlightening their minds , improving their morals , and giving protection to all their just rights as freedmen .
but the transfer of our political inheritance to them would , in my opinion , be an abandonment of a duty which we owe alike to the memory of our fathers and the rights of our children .
the plan of putting the southern states wholly and the general government partially into the hands of negroes is proposed at a time peculiarly unpropitious .
the foundations of society have been broken up by civil war .
industry must be reorganized , justice reestablished , public credit maintained , and order brought out of confusion .
to accomplish these ends would require all the wisdom and virtue of the great men who formed our institutions originally .
i confidently believe that their descendants will be equal to the arduous task before them , but it is worse than madness to expect that negroes will perform it for us .
certainly we ought not to ask their assistance till we despair of our own competency .
the great difference between the two races in physical , mental , and moral characteristics will prevent an amalgamation or fusion of them together in one homogeneous mass .
if the inferior obtains the ascendency over the other , it will govern with reference only to its own interests for it will recognize no common interest -- and create such a tyranny as this continent has never yet witnessed .
already the negroes are influenced by promises of confiscation and plunder .
they are taught to regard as an enemy every white man who has any respect for the rights of his own race .
if this continues it must become worse and worse , until all order will be subverted , all industry cease , and the fertile fields of the south grow up into a wilderness .
of all the dangers which our nation has yet encountered , none are equal to those which must result from the success of the effort now making to africanize the half of our country .
i would not put considerations of money in competition with justice and right ; but the expenses incident to " reconstruction " under the system adopted by congress aggravate what i regard as the intrinsic wrong of the measure itself .
it has cost uncounted millions already , and if persisted in will add largely to the weight of taxation , already too oppressive to be borne without just complaint , and may finally reduce the treasury of the nation to a condition of bankruptcy .
we must not delude ourselves .
it will require a strong standing army and probably more than $ 200,000,000 per annum to maintain the supremacy of negro governments after they are established .
the sum thus thrown away would , if properly used , form a sinking fund large enough to pay the whole national debt in less than fifteen years .
it is vain to hope that negroes will maintain their ascendency themselves .
without military power they are wholly incapable of holding in subjection the white people of the south .
i submit to the judgment of congress whether the public credit may not be injuriously affected by a system of measures like this .
with our debt and the vast private interests which are complicated with it , we can not be too cautious of a policy which might by possibility impair the confidence of the world in our government .
that confidence can only be retained by carefully inculcating the principles of justice and honor on the popular mind and by the most scrupulous fidelity to all our engagements of every sort .
any serious breach of the organic law , persisted in for a considerable time , can not but create fears for the stability of our institutions .
habitual violation of prescribed rules , which we bind ourselves to observe , must demoralize the people .
our only standard of civil duty being set at naught , the sheet anchor of our political morality is lost , the public conscience swings from its moorings and yields to every impulse of passion and interest .
if we repudiate the constitution , we will not be expected to care much for mere pecuniary obligations .
the violation of such a pledge as we made on the 22d day of july , 1861 , will assuredly diminish the market value of our other promises .
besides , if we acknowledge that the national debt was created , not to hold the states in the union , as the taxpayers were led to suppose , but to expel them from it and hand them over to be governed by negroes , the moral duty to pay it may seem much less clear .
i say it may seem so , for i do not admit that this or any other argument in favor of repudiation can be entertained as sound ; but its influence on some classes of minds may well be apprehended .
the financial honor of a great commercial nation , largely indebted and with a republican form of government administered by agents of the popular choice , is a thing of such delicate texture and the destruction of it would be followed by such unspeakable calamity that every true patriot must desire to avoid whatever might expose it to the slightest danger .
the great interests of the country require immediate relief from these enactments .
business in the south is paralyzed by a sense of general insecurity , by the terror of confiscation , and the dread of negro supremacy .
the southern trade , from which the north would have derived so great a profit under a government of law , still languishes , and can never be revived until it ceases to be fettered by the arbitrary power which makes all its operations unsafe .
that rich country -- the richest in natural resources the world ever saw -- is worse than lost if it be not soon placed under the protection of a free constitution .
instead of being , as it ought to be , a source of wealth and power , it will become an intolerable burden upon the rest of the nation .
another reason for retracing our steps will doubtless be seen by congress in the late manifestations of public opinion upon this subject .
we live in a country where the popular will always enforces obedience to itself , sooner or later .
it is vain to think of opposing it with anything short of legal authority backed by overwhelming force .
it can not have escaped your attention that from the day on which congress fairly and formally presented the proposition to govern the southern states by military force , with a view to the ultimate establishment of negro supremacy , every expression of the general sentiment has been more or less adverse to it .
the affections of this generation can not be detached from the institutions of their ancestors .
their determination to preserve the inheritance of free government in their own hands and transmit it undivided and unimpaired to their own posterity is too strong to be successfully opposed .
every weaker passion will disappear before that love of liberty and law for which the american people are distinguished above all others in the world .
how far the duty of the president " to preserve , protect , and defend the constitution " requires him to go in opposing an unconstitutional act of congress is a very serious and important question , on which i have deliberated much and felt extremely anxious to reach a proper conclusion .
where an act has been passed according to the forms of the constitution by the supreme legislative authority , and is regularly enrolled among the public statutes of the country , executive resistance to it , especially in times of high party excitement , would be likely to produce violent collision between the respective adherents of the two branches of the government .
this would be simply civil war , and civil war must be resorted to only as the last remedy for the worst of evils .
whatever might tend to provoke it should be most carefully avoided .
a faithful and conscientious magistrate will concede very much to honest error , and something even to perverse malice , before he will endanger the public peace ; and he will not adopt forcible measures , or such as might lead to force , as long as those which are peaceable remain open to him or to his constituents .
it is true that cases may occur in which the executive would be compelled to stand on its rights , and maintain them regardless of all consequences .
if congress should pass an act which is not only in palpable conflict with the constitution , but will certainly , if carried out , produce immediate and irreparable injury to the organic structure of the government , and if there be neither judicial remedy for the wrongs it inflicts nor power in the people to protect themselves without the official aid of their elected defender -- if , for instance , the legislative department should pass an act even through all the forms of law to abolish a coordinate department of the government -- in such a case the president must take the high responsibilities of his office and save the life of the nation at all hazards .
the so - called reconstruction acts , though as plainly unconstitutional as any that can be imagined , were not believed to be within the class last mentioned .
the people were not wholly dis - armed of the power of self - defense .
in all the northern states they still held in their hands the sacred right of the ballot , and it was safe to believe that in due time they would come to the rescue of their own institutions .
it gives me pleasure to add that the appeal to our common constituents was not taken in vain , and that my confidence in their wisdom and virtue seems not to have been misplaced .
it is well and publicly known that enormous frauds have been perpetrated on the treasury and that colossal fortunes have been made at the public expense .
this species of corruption has increased , is increasing , and if not diminished will soon bring us into total ruin and disgrace .
the public creditors and the taxpayers are alike interested in an honest administration of the finances , and neither class will long endure the large - handed robberies of the recent past .
for this discreditable state of things there are several causes .
some of the taxes are so laid as to present an irresistible temptation to evade payment .
the great sums which officers may win by connivance at fraud create a pressure which is more than the virtue of many can withstand , and there can be no doubt that the open disregard of constitutional obligations avowed by some of the highest and most influential men in the country has greatly weakened the moral sense of those who serve in subordinate places .
the expenses of the united states , including interest on the public debt , are more than six times as much as they were seven years ago .
to collect and disburse this vast amount requires careful supervision as well as systematic vigilance .
the system , never perfected , was much disorganized by the " tenure - of - office bill , " which has almost destroyed official accountability .
the president may be thoroughly convinced that an officer is incapable , dishonest , or unfaithful to the constitution , but under the law which i have named the utmost he can do is to complain to the senate and ask the privilege of supplying his place with a better man .
if the senate be regarded as personally or politically hostile to the president , it is natural , and not altogether unreasonable , for the officer to expect that it will take his part as far as possible , restore him to his place , and give him a triumph over his executive superior .
the officer has other chances of impunity arising from accidental defects of evidence , the mode of investigating it , and the secrecy of the hearing .
it is not wonderful that official malfeasance should become bold in proportion as the delinquents learn to think themselves safe .
i am entirely persuaded that under such a rule the president can not perform the great duty assigned to him of seeing the laws faithfully executed , and that it disables him most especially from enforcing that rigid accountability which is necessary to the due execution of the revenue laws .
the constitution invests the president with authority to decide whether a removal should be made in any given case ; the act of congress declares in substance that he shall only accuse such as he supposes to be unworthy of their trust .
the constitution makes him sole judge in the premises , but the statute takes away his jurisdiction , transfers it to the senate , and leaves him nothing but the odious and sometimes impracticable duty of becoming a prosecutor .
the prosecution is to be conducted before a tribunal whose members are not , like him , responsible to the whole people , but to separate constituent bodies , and who may hear his accusation with great disfavor .
the senate is absolutely without any known standard of decision applicable to such a case .
its judgment can not be anticipated , for it is not governed by any rule .
the law does not define what shall be deemed good cause for removal .
it is impossible even to conjecture what may or may not be so considered by the senate .
the nature of the subject forbids clear proof .
if the charge be incapacity , what evidence will support it ?
fidelity to the constitution may be understood or misunderstood in a thousand different ways , and by violent party men , in violent party times , unfaithfulness to the constitution may even come to be considered meritorious .
if the officer be accused of dishonesty , how shall it be made out ?
will it be inferred from acts unconnected with public duty , from private history , or from general reputation , or must the president await the commission of an actual misdemeanor in office ?
shall he in the meantime risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men to whom he can not give his confidence ?
must he forbear his complaint until the mischief is done and can not be prevented ?
if his zeal in the public service should impel him to anticipate the overt act , must he move at the peril of being tried himself for the offense of slandering his subordinate ?
in the present circumstances of the country someone must be held responsible for official delinquency of every kind .
it is extremely difficult to say where that responsibility should be thrown if it be not left where it has been placed by the constitution .
but all just men will admit that the president ought to be entirely relieved from such responsibility if he can not meet it by reason of restrictions placed by law upon his action .
the unrestricted power of removal from office is a very great one to be trusted even to a magistrate chosen by the general suffrage of the whole people and accountable directly to them for his acts .
it is undoubtedly liable to abuse , and at some periods of our history perhaps has been abused .
if it be thought desirable and constitutional that it should be so limited as to make the president merely a common informer against other public agents , he should at least be permitted to act in that capacity before some open tribunal , independent of party politics , ready to investigate the merits of every case , furnished with the means of taking evidence , and bound to decide according to established rules .
this would guarantee the safety of the accuser when he acts in good faith , and at the same time secure the rights of the other party .
i speak , of course , with all proper respect for the present senate , but it does not seem to me that any legislative body can be so constituted as to insure its fitness for these functions .
it is not the theory of this government that public offices are the property of those who hold them .
they are given merely as a trust for the public benefit , sometimes for a fixed period , sometimes during good behavior , but generally they are liable to be terminated at the pleasure of the appointing power , which represents the collective majesty and speaks the will of the people .
the forced retention in office of a single dishonest person may work great injury to the public interests .
the danger to the public service comes not from the power to remove , but from the power to appoint .
therefore it was that the framers of the constitution left the power of removal unrestricted , while they gave the senate a fight to reject all appointments which in its opinion were not fit to be made .
a little reflection on this subject will probably satisfy all who have the good of the country at heart that our best course is to take the constitution for our guide , walk in the path marked out by the founders of the republic , and obey the rules made sacred by the observance of our great predecessors .
the present condition of our finances and circulating medium is one to which your early consideration is invited .
the proportion which the currency of any country should bear to the whole value of the annual produce circulated by its means is a question upon which political economists have not agreed .
nor can it be controlled by legislation , but must be left to the irrevocable laws which everywhere regulate commerce and trade .
the circulating medium will ever irresistibly flow to those points where it is in greatest demand .
the law of demand and supply is as unerring as that which regulates the tides of the ocean ; and , indeed , currency , like the tides , has its ebbs and flows throughout the commercial world .
at the beginning of the rebellion the bank - note circulation of the country amounted to not much more than $ 200,000,000 ; now the circulation of national - bank notes and those known as " legal - tenders " is nearly seven hundred millions .
while it is urged by some that this amount should be increased , others contend that a decided reduction is absolutely essential to the best interests of the country .
in view of these diverse opinions , it may be well to ascertain the real value of our paper issues when compared with a metallic or convertible currency .
for this purpose let us inquire how much gold and silver could be purchased by the seven hundred millions of paper money now in circulation .
probably not more than half the amount of the latter , showing that when our paper currency is compared with gold and silver its commercial value is compressed into three hundred and fifty millions .
this striking fact makes it the obvious duty of the government , as early as may be consistent with the principles of sound political economy , to take such measures as will enable the holder of its notes and those of the national banks to convert them without loss into specie or its equivalent .
a reduction of our paper circulating medium need not necessarily follow .
this , however , would depend upon the law of demand and supply , though it should be borne in mind that by making legal - tender and bank notes convertible into coin or its equivalent their present specie value in the hands of their holders would be enhanced 100 per cent .
legislation for the accomplishment of a result so desirable is demanded by the highest public considerations .
the constitution contemplates that the circulating medium of the country shall be uniform in quality and value .
at the time of the formation of that instrument the country had just emerged from the war of the revolution , and was suffering from the effects of a redundant and worthless paper currency .
the sages of that period were anxious to protect their posterity from the evils that they themselves had experienced .
hence in providing a circulating medium they conferred upon congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof , at the same time prohibiting the states from making anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts .
the anomalous condition of our currency is in striking contrast with that which was originally designed .
our circulation now embraces , first , notes of the national banks , which are made receivable for all dues to the government , excluding imposts , and by all its creditors , excepting in payment of interest upon its bonds and the securities themselves ; second , legal - tender notes , issued by the united states , and which the law requires shall be received as well in payment of all debts between citizens as of all government dues , excepting imposts ; and , third .
gold and silver coin .
by the operation of our present system of finance , however , the metallic currency , when collected , is reserved only for one class of government creditors , who , holding its bonds , semiannually receive their interest in coin from the national treasury .
they are thus made to occupy an invidious position , which may be used to strengthen the arguments of those who would bring into disrepute the obligations of the nation .
in the payment of all its debts the plighted faith of the government should be inviolably maintained .
but while it acts with fidelity toward the bondholder who loaned his money that the integrity of the union might be preserved , it should at the same time observe good faith with the great masses of the people , who , having rescued the union from the perils of rebellion , now bear the burdens of taxation , that the government may be able to fulfill its engagements .
there is no reason which will be accepted as satisfactory by the people why those who defend us on the land and protect us on the sea ; the pensioner upon the gratitude of the nation , bearing the scars and wounds received while in its service ; the public servants in the various departments of the government ; the farmer who supplies the soldiers of the army and the sailors of the navy ; the artisan who toils in the nation 's workshops , or the mechanics and laborers who build its edifices and construct its forts and vessels of war , should , in payment of their just and hard - earned dues , receive depreciated paper , while another class of their countrymen , no more deserving , are paid in coin of gold and silver .
equal and exact justice requires that all the creditors of the government should be paid in a currency possessing a uniform value .
this can only be accomplished by the restoration of the currency to the standard established by the constitution ; and by this means we would remove a discrimination which may , if it has not already done so , create a prejudice that may become deep rooted and widespread and imperil the national credit .
the feasibility of making our currency correspond with the constitutional standard may be seen by reference to a few facts derived from our commercial statistics .
the production of precious metals in the united states from 1849 to 1857 , inclusive , amounted to $ 579,000,000 ; from 1858 to 1860 , inclusive , to $ 137,500,000 , and from 1861 to 1867 , inclusive , to $ 457,500,000 - -making the grand aggregate of products since 1849 $ 1,174,000,000 .
the amount of specie coined from 1849 to 1857 inclusive , was $ 439,000,000 ; from 1858 to 1860 , inclusive , $ 125,000,000 , and from 1861 to 1867 , inclusive , $ 310,000,000 - -making the total coinage since 1849 $ 874,000,000 .
from 1849 to 1857 , inclusive , the net exports of specie amounted to $ 271,000,000 ; from 1858 to 1860 , inclusive , to $ 148,000,000 , and from 1861 to 1867 , inclusive , $ 322,000,000 - -making the aggregate of net exports since 1849 $ 741,000,000 .
these figures show an excess of product over net exports of $ 433,000,000 .
there are in the treasury $ 111,000,000 in coin , something more than $ 40,000,000 in circulation on the pacific coast , and a few millions in the national and other banks -- in all about $ 160,000,000 .
this , however , taking into account the specie in the country prior to 1849 leaves more than $ 300,000,000 which have not been accounted for by exportation , and therefore may yet remain in the country .
these are important facts and show how completely the inferior currency will supersede the better , forcing it from circulation among the masses and causing it to be exported as a mere article of trade , to add to the money capital of foreign lands .
they show the necessity of retiring our paper money , that the return of gold and silver to the avenues of trade may be invited and a demand created which will cause the retention at home of at least so much of the productions of our rich and inexhaustible gold - bearing fields as may be sufficient for purposes of circulation .
it is unreasonable to expect a return to a sound currency so long as the government by continuing to issue irredeemable notes fills the channels of circulation with depreciated paper .
notwithstanding a coinage by our mints , since 1849 , of $ 874,000,000 , the people are now strangers to the currency which was designed for their use and benefit , and specimens of the precious metals bearing the national device are seldom seen , except when produced to gratify the interest excited by their novelty .
if depreciated paper is to be continued as the permanent currency of the country , and all our coin is to become a mere article of traffic and speculation , to the enhancement in price of all that is indispensable to the comfort of the people , it would be wise economy to abolish our mints thus saving the nation the care and expense incident to such establishments , and let all our precious metals be exported in bullion .
the time has come , however , when the government and national banks should be required to take the most efficient steps and make all necessary arrangements for a resumption of specie payments at the earliest practicable period .
specie payments having been once resumed by the government and banks , all notes or bills of paper issued by either of a less denomination than $ 20 should by law be excluded from circulation , so that the people may have the benefit and convenience of a gold and silver currency which in all their business transactions will be uniform in value at home and abroad .
every man of property or industry , every man who desires to preserve what he honestly possesses or to obtain what he can honestly earn , has a direct interest in maintaining a safe circulating medium -- such a medium as shall be real and substantial , not liable to vibrate with opinions , not subject to be blown up or blown down by the breath of speculation , but to be made stable and secure .
a disordered currency is one of the greatest political evils .
it undermines the virtues necessary for the support of the social system and encourages propensities destructive of its happiness ; it wars against industry , frugality , and economy , and it fosters the evil spirits of extravagance and speculation .
it has been asserted by one of our profound and most gifted statesmen that-- 
 of all the contrivances for cheating the laboring classes of mankind , none has been more effectual than that which deludes them with paper money .
this is the most effectual of inventions to fertilize the rich man 's fields by the sweat of the poor man 's brow .
ordinary tyranny , oppression , excessive taxation -- these bear lightly on the happiness of the mass of the community compared with a fraudulent currency and the robberies committed by depreciated paper .
our own history has recorded for our instruction enough , and more than enough , of the demoralizing tendency , the injustice , and the intolerable oppression on the virtuous and well disposed of a degraded paper currency authorized by law or in any way countenanced by government .
it is one of the most successful devices , in times of peace or war , expansions or revulsions , to accomplish the transfer of all the precious metals from the great mass of the people into the hands of the few , where they are hoarded in secret places or deposited in strong boxes under bolts and bars , while the people are left to endure all the inconvenience , sacrifice , and demoralization resulting from the use of a depreciated and worthless paper money .
the condition of our finances and the operations of our revenue system are set forth and fully explained in the able and instructive report of the secretary of the treasury .
on the 30th of june , 1866 , the public debt amounted to $ 2,783,425,879 ; on the 30th of june last it was $ 2,692,199,215 , showing a reduction during the fiscal year of $ 91,226,664 .
during the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1867 , the receipts were $ 490,634,010 and the expenditures $ 346,729,129 , leaving an available surplus of $ 143,904,880 .
it is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1868 , will be $ 417,161,928 and that the expenditures will reach the sum of $ 393,269,226 , leaving in the treasury a surplus of $ 23,892,702 .
for the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1869 , it is estimated that the receipts will amount to $ 381,000,000 and that the expenditures will be $ 372,000,000 , showing an excess of $ 9,000,000 in favor of the government .
the attention of congress is earnestly invited to the necessity of a thorough revision of our revenue system .
our internal - revenue laws and impost system should be so adjusted as to bear most heavily on articles of luxury , leaving the necessaries of life as free from taxation as may be consistent with the real wants of the government , economically administered .
taxation would not then fall unduly on the man of moderate means ; and while none would be entirely exempt from assessment , all , in proportion to their pecuniary abilities , would contribute toward the support of the state .
a modification of the internal - revenue system , by a large reduction in the number of articles now subject to tax , would be followed by results equally advantageous to the citizen and the government .
it would render the execution of the law less expensive and more certain , remove obstructions to industry , lessen the temptations to evade the law , diminish the violations and frauds perpetrated upon its provisions , make its operations less inquisitorial , and greatly reduce in numbers the army of taxgatherers created by the system , who " take from the mouth of honest labor the bread it has earned . "
retrenchment , reform , and economy should be carried into every branch of the public service , that the expenditures of the government may be reduced and the people relieved from oppressive taxation ; a sound currency should be restored , and the public faith in regard to the national debt sacredly observed .
the accomplishment of these important results , together with the restoration of the union of the states upon the principles of the constitution , would inspire confidence at home and abroad in the stability of our institutions and bring to the nation prosperity , peace , and good will .
the report of the secretary of war ad interim exhibits the operations of the army and of the several bureaus of the war department .
the aggregate strength of our military force on the 30th of september last was 56,315 .
the total estimate for military appropriations is $ 77,124,707 , including a deficiency in last year 's appropriation of $ 13,600,000 .
the payments at the treasury on account of the service of the war department from january 1 to october 29 , 1867 - -a period of ten months -- amounted to $ 109,807,000 .
the expenses of the military establishment , as well as the numbers of the army , are now three times as great as they have ever been in time of peace , while the discretionary , power is vested in the executive to add millions to this expenditure by an increase of the army to the maximum strength allowed by the law .
the comprehensive report of the secretary of the interior furnishes interesting information in reference to the important branches of the public service connected with his department .
the menacing attitude of some of the warlike bands of indians inhabiting the district of country between the arkansas and platte rivers and portions of dakota territory required the presence of a large military force in that region .
instigated by real or imaginary grievances , the indians occasionally committed acts of barbarous violence upon emigrants and our frontier settlements ; but a general indian war has been providentially averted .
the commissioners under the act of 20th july , 1867 , were invested with full power to adjust existing difficulties , negotiate treaties with the disaffected bands , and select for them reservations remote from the traveled routes between the mississippi and the pacific .
they entered without delay upon the execution of their trust , but have not yet made any official report of their proceedings .
it is of vital importance that our distant territories should be exempt from indian outbreaks , and that the construction of the pacific railroad , an object of national importance , should not be interrupted by hostile tribes .
these objects , as well as the material interests and the moral and intellectual improvement of the indians , can be most effectually secured by concentrating them upon portions of country set apart for their exclusive use and located at points remote from our highways and encroaching white settlements .
since the commencement of the second session of the thirty - ninth congress 510 miles of road have been constructed on the main line and branches of the pacific railway .
the line from omaha is rapidly approaching the eastern base of the rocky mountains , while the terminus of the last section of constructed road in california , accepted by the government on the 24th day of october last , was but 11 miles distant from the summit of the sierra nevada .
the remarkable energy evinced by the companies offers the strongest assurance that the completion of the road from sacramento to omaha will not be long deferred .
during the last fiscal year 7,041,114 acres of public land were disposed of , and the cash receipts from sales and fees exceeded by one - half million dollars the sum realized from those sources during the preceding year .
the amount paid to pensioners , including expenses of disbursements , was $ 18,619,956 , and 36,482 names were added to the rolls .
the entire number of pensioners on the 30th of june last was 155,474 .
eleven thousand six hundred and fifty - five patents and designs were issued during the year ending september 30 , 1867 , and at that date the balance in the treasury to the credit of the patent fund was $ 286,607 .
the report of the secretary of the navy states that we have seven squadrons actively and judiciously employed , under efficient and able commanders , in protecting the persons and property of american citizens , maintaining the dignity and power of the government , and promoting the commerce and business interests of our countrymen in every part of the world .
of the 238 vessels composing the present navy of the united states , 56 , carrying 507 guns , are in squadron service .
during the year the number of vessels in commission has been reduced 12 , and there are 13 less on squadron duty than there were at the date of the last report .
a large number of vessels were commenced and in the course of construction when the war terminated , and although congress had made the necessary appropriations for their completion , the department has either suspended work upon them or limited the slow completion of the steam vessels , so as to meet the contracts for machinery made with private establishments .
the total expenditures of the navy department for the fiscal year ending june 30 , 1867 , were $ 31,034,011 .
no appropriations have been made .
or required since the close of the war for the construction and repair of vessels , for steam machinery , ordnance , provisions and clothing , fuel , hemp , etc . ,
the balances under these several heads having been more than sufficient for current expenditures .
it should also be stated to the credit of the department that , besides asking no appropriations for the above objects for the last two years , the secretary of the navy , on the 30th of september last , in accordance with the act of may 1 , 1820 , requested the secretary of the treasury to carry to the surplus fund the sum of $ 65,000.000 , being the amount received from the sales of vessels and other war property and the remnants of former appropriations .
the report of the postmaster - general shows the business of the post - office department and the condition of the postal service in a very favorable light , and the attention of congress is called to its practical recommendations .
the receipts of the department for the year ending june 30 , 1867 , including all special appropriations for sea and land service and for free mail matter , were $ 19,978,693 .
the expenditures for all purposes were $ 19,235,483 , leaving an unexpended balance in favor of the department of $ 743,210 , which can be applied toward the expenses of the department for the current year .
the increase of postal revenue , independent of specific appropriations , for the year 1867 over that of 1866 was $ 850,040 .
the increase of revenue from the sale of stamps and stamped envelopes was $ 783,404 .
the increase of expenditures for 1867 over those of the previous year was owing chiefly to the extension of the land and ocean mail service .
during the past year new postal conventions have been ratified and exchanged with the united kingdom of great britain and ireland , belgium , the netherlands , switzerland , the north german union , italy , and the colonial government at hong kong , reducing very largely the rates of ocean and land postages to and from and within those countries .
the report of the acting commissioner of agriculture concisely presents the condition , wants , and progress of an interest eminently worthy the fostering care of congress , and exhibits a large measure of useful results achieved during the year to which it refers .
the reestablishment of peace at home and the resumption of extended trade , travel , and commerce abroad have served to increase the number and variety of questions in the department for foreign affairs .
none of these questions , however , have seriously disturbed our relations with other states .
the republic of mexico , having been relieved from foreign intervention , is earnestly engaged in efforts to reestablish her constitutional system of government .
a good understanding continues to exist between our government and the republics of hayti and san domingo , and our cordial relations with the central and south american states remain unchanged .
the tender , made in conformity with a resolution of congress , of the good offices of the government with a view to an amicable adjustment of peace between brazil and her allies on one side and paraguay on the other , and between chile and her allies on the one side and spain on the other , though kindly received , has in neither case been fully accepted by the belligerents .
the war in the valley of the parana is still vigorously maintained .
on the other hand , actual hostilities between the pacific states and spain have been more than a year suspended .
i shall , on any proper occasion that may occur , renew the conciliatory recommendations which have been already made .
brazil , with enlightened sagacity and comprehensive statesmanship , has opened the great channels of the amazon and its tributaries to universal commerce .
one thing more seems needful to assure a rapid and cheering progress in south america .
i refer to those peaceful habits without which states and nations can not in this age well expect material prosperity or social advancement .
the exposition of universal industry at paris has passed , and seems to have fully realized the high expectations of the french government .
if due allowance be made for the recent political derangement of industry here , the part which the united states has borne in this exhibition of invention and art may be regarded with very high satisfaction .
during the exposition a conference was held of delegates from several nations , the united states being one , in which the inconveniences of commerce and social intercourse resulting from the diverse standards of money value were very fully discussed , and plans were developed for establishing by universal consent a common principle for the coinage of gold .
these conferences are expected to be renewed , with the attendance of many foreign states not hitherto represented .
a report of these interesting proceedings will be submitted to congress , which will , no doubt , justly appreciate the great object and be ready to adopt any measure which may tend to facilitate its ultimate accomplishment .
on the 25th of february , 1862 , congress declared by law that treasury notes , without interest , authorized by that act should be legal tender in payment of all debts , public and private , within the united states .
an annual remittance of $ 30,000 , less stipulated expenses , accrues to claimants under the convention made with spain in 1834 .
these remittances , since the passage of that act , have been paid in such notes .
the claimants insist that the government ought to require payment in coin .
the subject may be deemed worthy of your attention .
no arrangement has yet been reached for the settlement of our claims for british depredations upon the commerce of the united states .
i have felt it my duty to decline the proposition of arbitration made by her majesty 's government , because it has hitherto been accompanied by reservations and limitations incompatible with the rights , interest , and honor of our country .
it is not to be apprehended that great britain will persist in her refusal to satisfy these just and reasonable claims , which involve the sacred principle of nonintervention -- a principle henceforth not more important to the united states than to all other commercial nations .
the west india islands were settled and colonized by european states simultaneously with the settlement and colonization of the american continent .
most of the colonies planted here became independent nations in the close of the last and the beginning of the present century .
our own country embraces communities which at one period were colonies of great britain , france , spain , holland , sweden , and russia .
the people in the west indies , with the exception of those of the island of hayti , have neither attained nor aspired to independence , nor have they become prepared for self - defense .
although possessing considerable commercial value , they have been held by the several european states which colonized or at some time conquered them , chiefly for purposes of military and naval strategy in carrying out european policy and designs in regard to this continent .
in our revolutionary war ports and harbors in the west india islands were used by our enemy , to the great injury and embarrassment of the united states .
we had the same experience in our second war with great britain .
the same european policy for a long time excluded us even from trade with the west indies , while we were at peace with all nations .
in our recent civil war the rebels and their piratical and blockade - breaking allies found facilities in the same ports for the work , which they too successfully accomplished , of injuring and devastating the commerce which we are now engaged in rebuilding .
we labored especially under this disadvantage , that european steam vessels employed by our enemies found friendly shelter , protection , and supplies in west indian ports , while our naval operations were necessarily carried on from our own distant shores .
there was then a universal feeling of the want of an advanced naval outpost between the atlantic coast and europe .
the duty of obtaining such an outpost peacefully and lawfully , while neither doing nor menacing injury to other states , earnestly engaged the attention of the executive department before the close of the war , and it has not been lost sight of since that time .
a not entirely dissimilar naval want revealed itself during the same period on the pacific coast .
the required foothold there was fortunately secured by our late treaty with the emperor of russia , and it now seems imperative that the more obvious necessities of the atlantic coast should not be less carefully provided for .
a good and convenient port and harbor , capable of easy defense , will supply that want .
with the possession of such a station by the united states , neither we nor any other american nation need longer apprehend injury or offense from any transatlantic enemy .
i agree with our early statesmen that the west indies naturally gravitate to , and may be expected ultimately to be absorbed by , the continental states , including our own .
i agree with them also that it is wise to leave the question of such absorption to this process of natural political gravitation .
the islands of st. thomas and st. john , which constitute a part of the group called the virgin islands , seemed to offer us advantages immediately desirable , while their acquisition could be secured in harmony with the principles to which i have alluded .
a treaty has therefore been concluded with the king of denmark for the cession of those islands , and will be submitted to the senate for consideration .
it will hardly be necessary to call the attention of congress to the subject of providing for the payment to russia of the sum stipulated in the treaty for the cession of alaska .
possession having been formally delivered to our commissioner , the territory remains for the present in care of a military force , awaiting such civil organization as shall be directed by congress .
the annexation of many small german states to prussia and the reorganization of that country under a new and liberal constitution have induced me to renew the effort to obtain a just and prompt settlement of the long - vexed question concerning the claims of foreign states for military service from their subjects naturalized in the united states .
in connection with this subject the attention of congress is respectfully called to a singular and embarrassing conflict of laws .
the executive department of this government has hitherto uniformly held , as it now holds , that naturalization in conformity with the constitution and laws of the united states absolves the recipient from his native allegiance .
the courts of great britain hold that allegiance to the british crown is indefensible , and is not absolved by our laws of naturalization .
british judges cite courts and law authorities of the united states in support of that theory against the position held by the executive authority of the united states .
this conflict perplexes the public mind concerning the rights of naturalized citizens and impairs the national authority abroad .
i called attention to this subject in my last annual message , and now again respectfully appeal to congress to declare the national will unmistakably upon this important question .
the abuse of our laws by the clandestine prosecution of the african slave trade from american ports or by american citizens has altogether ceased , and under existing circumstances no apprehensions of its renewal in this part of the world are entertained .
under these circumstances it becomes a question whether we shall not propose to her majesty 's government a suspension or discontinuance of the stipulations for maintaining a naval force for the suppression of that trade .

by the president of the united states of america 
 a proclamation 
 whereas by proclamations of the 15th and 19th of april , 1861 , the president of the united states , in virtue of the power vested in him by the constitution and the laws , declared that the laws of the united states were opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in the states of south carolina , georgia , alabama , florida , mississippi , louisiana , and texas by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the marshals by law ; and 
 whereas by another proclamation , made on the 16th day of august , in the same year , in pursuance of an act of congress approved july 13 , 1861 , the inhabitants of the states of georgia , south carolina , virginia , north carolina , tennessee , alabama , louisiana , texas , arkansas , mississippi , and florida ( except the inhabitants of that part of the state of virginia lying west of the alleghany mountains and of such other parts of that state and the other states before named as might maintain a loyal adhesion to the union and the constitution or might be from time to time occupied and controlled by forces of the united states engaged in the dispersion of insurgents ) were declared to be in a state of insurrection against the united states ; and 
 whereas by another proclamation , of the 1st day of july , 1862 , issued in pursuance of an act of congress approved june 7 , in the same year , the insurrection was declared to be still existing in the states aforesaid , with the exception of certain specified counties in the state of virginia ; and 
 whereas by another proclamation , made on the 2d , day of april , 1863 , in pursuance of the act of congress of july 13 , 1861 , the exceptions named in the proclamation of august 16 , 1861 , were revoked and the inhabitants of the states of georgia , south carolina , north carolina , tennessee , alabama , louisiana , texas , arkansas , mississippi , florida , and virginia ( except the forty - eight counties of virginia designated as west virginia and the ports of new orleans , key west , port royal , and beaufort , in north carolina ) were declared to be still in a state of insurrection against the united states ; and 
 whereas the house of representatives , on the 22d day of july , 1861 , adopted a resolution in the words following , namely : 
 resolved by the house of representatives of the congress of the united states , that the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the country by the dis - unionists of the southern states now in revolt against the constitutional government and in arms around the capital ; that in this national emergency congress , banishing all feelings of mere passion or resentment , will recollect only its duty to the whole country ; that this war is not waged upon our part in any spirit of oppression , nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation .
nor purpose of overthrowing interfering with the rights or established institutions of those states , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the constitution and to preserve the union , with all the dignity , equality , and rights of the several states unimpaired ; and that as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease .
and whereas the senate of the united states , on the 25th day of july .
1861 , adopted a resolution in the words following , to wit : 
 resolved , that the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the country by the disunionists of the southern states now in revolt against the constitutional government and in arms around the capital ; that in this national emergency congress , banishing all feeling of mere passion or resentment , will recollect only its duty to the whole country ; that this war is not prosecuted upon our part in any spirit of oppression , nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation , nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those states , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof and to preserve the union , with all the dignity , equality , and rights of the several states unimpaired ; that as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease .
and whereas these resolutions , though not joint or concurrent in form , are substantially identical , and as such may be regarded as having expressed the sense of congress upon the subject to which they relate ; and 
 whereas by my proclamation of the 13th day of june last the insurrection in the state of tennessee was declared to have been suppressed , the authority of the united states therein to be undisputed , and such united states officers as had been duly commissioned to be in the undisturbed exercise of their official functions ; and 
 whereas there now exists no organized armed resistance of misguided citizens or others to the authority of the united states in the states of georgia , south carolina , virginia , north carolina , tennessee , alabama , louisiana , arkansas , mississippi , and florida , and the laws can be sustained and enforced therein by the proper civil authority , state or federal , and the people of said states are well and loyally disposed and have conformed or will conform in their legislation to the condition of affairs growing out of the amendment to the constitution of the united states prohibiting slavery within the limits and jurisdiction of the united states ; and 
 whereas , in view of the before - recited premises , it is the manifest determination of the american people that no state of its own will has the right or the power to go out of , or separate itself from , or be separated from , the american union , and that therefore each state ought to remain and constitute an integral part of the united states ; and 
 whereas the people of the several before - mentioned states have , in the manner aforesaid , given satisfactory evidence that they acquiesce in this sovereign and important resolution of national unity ; and 
 whereas it is believed to be a fundamental principle of government that people who have revolted and who have been overcome and subdued must either be dealt with so as to induce them voluntarily to become friends or else they must be held by absolute military power or devastated so as to prevent them from ever again doing harm as enemies , which last - named policy is abhorrent to humanity and to freedom ; and 
 whereas the constitution of the united states provides for constituent communities only as states , and not as territories , dependencies , provinces , or protectorates ; and 
 whereas such constituent states must necessarily be , and by the constitution and laws of the united states are , made equals and placed upon a like footing as to political rights , immunities , dignity , and power with the several states with which they are united ; and 
 whereas the observance of political equality , as a principle of right and justice , is well calculated to encourage the people of the aforesaid states to be and become more and more constant and persevering in their renewed allegiance ; and 
 whereas standing armies , military occupation , martial law , military tribunals , and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus are in time of peace dangerous to public liberty , incompatible with the individual rights of the citizen , contrary to the genius and spirit of our free institutions , and exhaustive of the national resources , and ought not , therefore , to be sanctioned or allowed except in cases of actual necessity for repelling invasion or suppressing insurrection or rebellion ; and 
 whereas the policy of the government of the united states from the beginning of the insurrection to its overthrow and final suppression has been in conformity with the principles herein set forth and enumerated : 
 now , therefore , i , andrew johnson , president of the united states , do hereby proclaim and declare that the insurrection which heretofore existed in the states of georgia , south carolina , virginia , north carolina , tennessee , alabama , louisiana , arkansas , mississippi , and florida is at an end and is henceforth to be so regarded .
in testimony whereof i have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the united states to be affixed .

whereas the fourth section of the fourth article of the constitution of the united states declares that the united states shall guarantee to every state in the union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion and domestic violence ; and 
 whereas the president of the united states is by the constitution made commander in chief of the army and navy , as well as chief civil executive officer of the united states , and is bound by solemn oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the united states and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed ; and 
 whereas the rebellion which has been waged by a portion of the people of the united states against the properly constituted authorities of the government thereof in the most violent and revolting form , but whose organized and armed forces have now been almost entirely overcome , has in its revolutionary progress deprived the people of the state of north carolina of all civil government ; and 
 whereas it becomes necessary and proper to carry out and enforce the obligations of the united states to the people of north carolina in securing them in the enjoyment of a republican form of government : 
 now , therefore , in obedience to the high and solemn duties imposed upon me by the constitution of the united states and for the purpose of enabling the loyal people of said state to organize a state government whereby justice may be established , domestic tranquillity insured , and loyal citizens protected in all their rights of life , liberty , and property , i , andrew johnson , president of the united states and commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states , do hereby appoint william w. holden provisional governor of the state of north carolina , whose duty it shall be , at the earliest practicable period , to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for convening a convention composed of delegates to be chosen by that portion of the people of said state who are loyal to the united states , and no others , for the purpose of altering or amending the constitution thereof , and with authority to exercise within the limits of said state all the powers necessary .
and proper to enable such loyal people of the state of north carolina to restore said state to its constitutional relations to the federal government and to present such a republican form of state government as will entitle the state to the guaranty of the united states therefor and its people to protection by the united states against invasion , insurrection , and domestic violence : provided , that in any election that may be hereafter held for choosing delegates to any state convention as aforesaid no person shall be qualified as an elector or shall be eligible as a member of such convention unless he shall have previously taken and subscribed the oath of amnesty as set forth in the president 's proclamation of may 29 , a. d. 1865 , and is a voter qualified as prescribed by the constitution and laws of the state of north carolina in force immediately before the 20th day of may , a. d. 1861 , the date of the so - called ordinance of secession : and the said convention , when convened , or the legislature that may be thereafter assembled , will prescribe the qualification of electors and the eligibility of persons to hold office under the constitution and laws of the state -- a power the people of the several states composing the federal union have rightfully exercised from the origin of the government to the present time .
and i do hereby direct-- 
 first .

andrew johnson .
by the president : 
 william h. seward , 
 secretary of state
to the senate of the united states : 
 i return for reconsideration a bill entitled " an act for the admission of the state of nebraska into the union , " which originated in the senate and has received the assent of both houses of congress .
a bill having in view the same object was presented for my approval a few hours prior to the adjournment of the last session , but , submitted at a time when there was no opportunity for a proper consideration of the subject , i withheld my signature and the measure failed to become a law .
it appears by the preamble of this bill that the people of nebraska , availing themselves of the authority conferred upon them by the act passed on the 19th day of april , 1864 , " have adopted a constitution which , upon due examination , is found to conform to the provisions and comply with the conditions of said act , and to be republican in its form of government , and that they now ask for admission into the union . "
this proposed law would therefore seem to be based upon the declaration contained in the enabling act that upon compliance with its terms the people of nebraska should be admitted into the union upon an equal footing with the original states .
reference to the bill , however , shows that while by the first section congress distinctly accepts , ratifies , and confirms the constitution and state government which the people of the territory have formed for themselves , declares nebraska to be one of the united states of america , and admits her into the union upon an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatsoever , the third section provides that this measure " shall not take effect except upon the fundamental condition that within the state of nebraska there shall be no denial of the elective franchise , or of any other right , to any person by reason of race or color , excepting indians not taxed ; and upon the further fundamental condition that the legislature of said state , by a solemn public act , shall declare the assent of said state to the said fundamental condition , and shall transmit to the president of the united states an authentic copy of said act , upon receipt whereof the president , by proclamation , shall forthwith announce the fact , whereupon said fundamental condition shall be held as a part of the organic law of the state ; and thereupon , and without any further proceeding on the part of congress , the admission of said state into the union shall be considered as complete . "
this condition is not mentioned in the original enabling act ; was not contemplated at the time of its passage ; was not sought by the people themselves ; has not heretofore been applied to the inhabitants of any state asking admission , and is in direct conflict with the constitution adopted by the people and declared in the preamble " to be republican in its form of government , " for in that instrument the exercise of the elective franchise and the right to hold office are expressly limited to white citizens of the united states .
congress thus undertakes to authorize and compel the legislature to change a constitution which , it is declared in the preamble , has received the sanction of the people , and which by this bill is " accepted , ratified , and confirmed " by the congress of the nation .
the first and third sections of the bill exhibit yet further incongruity .
by the one nebraska is " admitted into the union upon an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatsoever , " while by the other congress demands as a condition precedent to her admission requirements which in our history have never been asked of any people when presenting a constitution and state government for the acceptance of the lawmaking power .
it is expressly declared by the third section that the bill " shall not take effect except upon the fundamental condition that within the state of nebraska there shall be no denial of the elective franchise , or of any other right , to any person by reason of race or color , excepting indians not taxed . "
neither more nor less than the assertion of the right of congress to regulate the elective franchise of any state hereafter to be admitted , this condition is in clear violation of the federal constitution , under the provisions of which , from the very foundation of the government , each state has been left free to determine for itself the qualifications necessary for the exercise of suffrage within its limits .
without precedent in our legislation , it is in marked contrast with those limitations which , imposed upon states that from time to time have become members of the union , had for their object the single purpose of preventing any infringement of the constitution of the country .
if congress is satisfied that nebraska at the present time possesses sufficient population to entitle her to full representation in the councils of the nation , and that her people desire an exchange of a territorial for a state government , good faith would seem to demand that she should be admitted without further requirements than those expressed in the enabling act , with all of which , it is asserted in the preamble , her inhabitants have complied .
congress may , under the constitution , admit new states or reject them , but the people of a state can alone make or change their organic law and prescribe the qualifications requisite for electors .
congress , however , in passing the bill in the shape in which it has been submitted for my approval , does not merely reject the application of the people of nebraska for present admission as a state into the union , on the ground that the constitution which they have submitted restricts the exercise of the elective franchise to the white population , but imposes conditions which , if accepted by the legislature , may , without the consent of the people , so change the organic law as to make electors of all persons within the state without distinction of race or color .
in view of this fact , i suggest for the consideration of congress whether it would not be just , expedient , and in accordance with the principles of our government to allow the people , by popular vote or through a convention chosen by themselves for that purpose , to declare whether or not they will accept the terms upon which it is now proposed to admit them into the union .
this course would not occasion much greater delay than that which the bill contemplates when it requires that the legislature shall be convened within thirty days after this measure shall have become a law for the purpose of considering and deciding the conditions which it imposes , and gains additional force when we consider that the proceedings attending the formation of the state constitution were not in conformity with the provisions of the enabling act ; that in an aggregate vote of 7,776 the majority in favor of the constitution did not exceed 100 ; and that it is alleged that , in consequence of frauds , even this result can not be received as a fair expression of the wishes of the people .
as upon them must fall the burdens of a state organization , it is but just that they should be permitted to determine for themselves a question which so materially affects their interests .
possessing a soil and a climate admirably adapted to those industrial pursuits which bring prosperity and greatness to a people , with the advantage of a central position on the great highway that will soon connect the atlantic and pacific states , nebraska is rapidly gaining in numbers and wealth , and may within a very brief period claim admission on grounds which will challenge and secure universal assent .
she can therefore wisely and patiently afford to wait .
her population is said to be steadily and even rapidly increasing , being now generally conceded as high as 40,000 , and estimated by some whose judgment is entitled to respect at a still greater number .
at her present rate of growth she will in a very short time have the requisite population for a representative in congress , and , what is far more important to her own citizens , will have realized such an advance in material wealth as will enable the expenses of a state government to be borne without oppression to the taxpayer .
of new communities it may be said with special force -- and it is true of old ones -- that the inducement to emigrants , other things being equal , is in almost the precise ratio of the rate of taxation .
the great states of the northwest owe their marvelous prosperity largely to the fact that they were continued as territories until they had grown to be wealthy and populous communities .

 washington , d. c. 
 sir : the hon .
edwin m. stanton having been this day suspended as secretary of war , you are hereby authorized and empowered to act as secretary of war ad interim , and will at once enter upon the discharge of the duties of the office .
the secretary of war has been instructed to transfer to you all the records , books , papers , and other public property now in his custody and charge .
the following communication was received from mr. stanton : 
 war department , 
 august 12 , 1867 .
the president .
sir : your note of this date has been received , informing me that by virtue of the powers and authority vested in you as president by the constitution and laws of the united states i am suspended from office as secretary of war , and will cease to exercise any and all functions pertaining to the same , and also directing me at once to transfer to general ulysses s. grant , who has this day been authorized and empowered to act as secretary of war ad interim , all records , books , papers , and other public property now in my custody and charge .
under a sense of public duty i am compelled to deny your right under the constitution and laws of the united states , without the advice and consent of the senate and without any legal cause , to suspend me from office as secretary of war or the exercise of any or all functions pertaining to the same , or without such advice and consent to compel me to transfer to any person the records , books , papers , and public property in my custody as secretary .
but inasmuch as the general commanding the armies of the united states has been appointed ad interim , and has notified me that he has accepted the appointment , i have no alternative but to submit , under protest , to superior force .
to the president .
the suspension has not been revoked , and the business of the war department is conducted by the secretary ad interim .
prior to the date of this suspension i had come to the conclusion that the time had arrived when it was proper mr. stanton should retire from my cabinet .
the mutual confidence and general accord which should exist in such a relation had ceased .
i supposed that mr. stanton was well advised that his continuance in the cabinet was contrary to my wishes , for i had repeatedly given him so to understand by every mode short of an express request that he should resign .
having waited full time for the voluntary action of mr. stanton , and seeing no manifestation on his part of an intention to resign , i addressed him the following note on the 5th of august : 
 sir : public considerations of a high character constrain me to say that your resignation as secretary of war will be accepted .
to this note i received the following reply : 
 war department , 
 august 5 , 1867 .
sir : your note of this day has been received , stating that public considerations of a high character constrain you to say that my resignation as secretary of war will be accepted .
in reply i have the honor to say that public considerations of a high character , which alone have induced me to continue at the head of this department , constrain me not to resign the office of secretary of war before the next meeting of congress .
edwin m. stanton 
 secretary of war 
 this reply of mr. stanton was not merely a disinclination of compliance with the request for his resignation ; it was a defiance , and something more .
mr. stanton does not content himself with assuming that public considerations bearing upon his continuance in office form as fully a rule of action for himself as for the president , and that upon so delicate a question as the fitness of an officer for continuance in his office the officer is as competent and as impartial to decide as his superior , who is responsible for his conduct .
but he goes further , and plainly intimates what he means by " public considerations of a high character , " and this is nothing else than his loss of confidence in his superior .
he says that these public considerations have " alone induced me to continue at the head of this department , " and that they " constrain me not to resign the office of secretary of war before the next meeting of congress . "
this language is very significant .
mr. stanton holds the position unwillingly .
he continues in office only under a sense of high public duty .
he is ready to leave when it is safe to leave , and as the danger he apprehends from his removal then will not exist when congress is here , he is constrained to remain during the interim .
what , then , is that danger which can only be averted by the presence of mr. stanton or of congress ?
mr. stanton does not say that " public considerations of a high character " constrain him to hold on to the office indefinitely .
he does not say that no one other than himself can at any time be found to take his place and perform its duties .
on the contrary , he expresses a desire to leave the office at the earliest moment consistent with these high public considerations .
he says , in effect , that while congress is away he must remain , but that when congress is here he can go .
in other words , he has lost confidence in the president .
he is unwilling to leave the war department in his hands or in the hands of anyone the president may appoint or designate to perform its duties .
if he resigns , the president may appoint a secretary of war that mr. stanton does not approve ; therefore he will not resign .
but when congress is in session the president can not appoint a secretary of war which the senate does not approve ; consequently when congress meets mr. stanton is ready to resign .
whatever cogency these " considerations " may have had on mr. stanton , whatever right he may have had to entertain such considerations , whatever propriety there might be in the expression of them to others , one thing is certain , it was official misconduct , to say the least of it , to parade them before his superior officer .
upon the receipt of this extraordinary note i only delayed the order of suspension long enough to make the necessary arrangements to fill the office .
if this were the only cause for his suspension , it would be ample .
necessarily it must end our most important official relations , for i can not imagine a degree of effrontery which would embolden the head of a department to take his seat at the council table in the executive mansion after such an act ; nor can i imagine a president so forgetful of the proper respect and dignity which belong to his office as to submit to such intrusion .
i will not do mr. stanton the wrong to suppose that he entertained any idea of offering to act as one of my constitutional advisers after that note was written .
there was an interval of a week between that date and the order of suspension , during which two cabinet meetings were held .
mr. stanton did not present himself at either , nor was he expected .
on the 12th of august mr. stanton was notified of his suspension and that general grant had been authorized to take charge of the department .
in his answer to this notification , of the same date , mr. stanton expresses himself as follows : 
 " under a sense of public duty , i am compelled to deny your fight under the constitution and laws of the united states , without the advice and consent of the senate and without any legal cause , to suspend me from office as secretary of war or the exercise of any or all functions pertaining to the same , or without such advice and consent to compel me to transfer to any person the records , books , papers , and public property in my custody as secretary .
but inasmuch as the general commanding the armies of the united states has been appointed ad interim , and has notified me that he has accepted the appointment , i have no alternative but to submit , under protest , to superior force . "
it will not escape attention that in his note of august 5 mr. stanton stated that he had been constrained to continue in the office , even before he was requested to resign , by considerations of a high public character .
in this note of august 12 a new and different sense of public duty compels him to deny the president 's right to suspend him from office without the consent of the senate .
this last is the public duty of resisting an act contrary to law , and he charges the president with violation of the law in ordering his suspension .
mr. stanton refers generally to the constitution and laws of the " united states , " and says that a sense of public duty " under " these compels him to deny the right of the president to suspend him from office .
as to his sense of duty under the constitution , that will be considered in the sequel .
as to his sense of duty under " the laws of the united states , " he certainly can not refer to the law which creates the war department , for that expressly confers upon the president the unlimited right to remove the head of the department .
the only other law bearing upon the question is the tenure - of - office act , passed by congress over the presidential veto march 2 , 1867 .
this is the law which , under a sense of public duty , mr. stanton volunteers to defend .
there is no provision in this law which compels any officer coming within its provisions to remain in office .
it forbids removals -- not resignations .
mr. stanton was perfectly free to resign at any moment , either upon his own motion or in compliance with a request or an order .
it was a matter of choice or of taste .
there was nothing compulsory in the nature of legal obligation .
nor does he put his action upon that imperative ground .
he says he acts under a " sense of public duty , " not of legal obligation , compelling him to hold on and leaving him no choice .
the public duty which is upon him arises from the respect which he owes to the constitution and the laws , violated in his own case .
he is therefore compelled by this sense of public duty to vindicate violated law and to stand as its champion .
this was not the first occasion in which mr. stanton , in discharge of a public duty , was called upon to consider the provisions of that law .
that tenure - of - office law did not pass without notice .
like other acts , it was sent to the president for approval .
as is my custom , i submitted its consideration to my cabinet for their advice upon the question whether i should approve it or not .
it was a grave question of constitutional law , in which i would , of course , rely most upon the opinion of the attorney - general and of mr. stanton , who had once been attorney - general .
every member of my cabinet advised me that the proposed law was unconstitutional .
all spoke without doubt or reservation , but mr. stanton 's condemnation of the law was the most elaborate and emphatic .
he referred to the constitutional provisions , the debates in congress , especially to the speech of mr. buchanan when a senator , to the decisions of the supreme court , and to the usage from the beginning of the government through every successive administration , all concurring to establish the right of removal as vested by the constitution in the president .
to all these he added the weight of his own deliberate judgment , and advised me that it was my duty to defend the power of the president from usurpation and to veto the law .
i do not know when a sense of public duty is more imperative upon a head of department than upon such an occasion as this .
he acts then under the gravest obligations of law , for when he is called upon by the president for advice it is the constitution which speaks to him .
all his other duties are left by the constitution to be regulated by statute , but this duty was deemed so momentous that it is imposed by the constitution itself .
after all this i was not prepared for the ground taken by mr. stanton in his note of august 12 .
i was not prepared to find him compelled by a new and indefinite sense of public duty , under " the constitution , " to assume the vindication of a law which , under the solemn obligations of public duty imposed by the constitution itself , he advised me was a violation of that constitution .
i make great allowance for a change of opinion , but such a change as this hardly falls within the limits of greatest indulgence .
where our opinions take the shape of advice , and influence the action of others , the utmost stretch of charity will scarcely justify us in repudiating them when they come to be applied to ourselves .
but to proceed with the narrative .
i was so much struck with the full mastery of the question manifested by mr. stanton , and was at the time so fully occupied with the preparation of another veto upon the pending reconstruction act , that i requested him to prepare the veto upon this tenure - of - office bill .
this he declined , on the ground of physical disability to undergo at the time the labor of writing , but stated his readiness to furnish what aid might be required in the preparation of materials for the paper .
at the time this subject was before the cabinet it seemed to be taken for granted that as to those members of the cabinet who had been appointed by mr. lincoln their tenure of office was not fixed by the provisions of the act .
i do not remember that the point was distinctly decided , but i well recollect that it was suggested by one member of the cabinet who was appointed by mr. lincoln , and that no dissent was expressed .
whether the point was well taken or not did not seem to me of any consequence , for the unanimous expression of opinion against the constitutionality and policy of the act was so decided that i felt no concern , so far as the act had reference to the gentlemen then present , that i would be embarrassed in the future .
the bill had not then become a law .
the limitation upon the power of removal was not yet imposed , and there was yet time to make any changes .
if any one of these gentlemen had then said to me that he would avail himself of the provisions of that bill in case it became a law , i should not have hesitated a moment as to his removal .
no pledge was then expressly given or required .
but there are circumstances when to give an expressed pledge is not necessary , and when to require it is an imputation of possible bad faith .
i felt that if these gentlemen came within the purview of the bill it was as to them a dead letter , and that none of them would ever take refuge under its provisions .
i now pass to another subject .
when , on the 15th of april , 1865 , the duties of the presidential office devolved upon me , i found a full cabinet of seven members , all of them selected by mr. lincoln .
i made no change .
on the contrary , i shortly afterwards ratified a change determined upon by mr. lincoln , but not perfected at his death , and admitted his appointee , mr. harlan , in the place of mr. usher , who was in office at the time .
the great duty of the time was to reestablish government , law , and order in the insurrectionary states .
congress was then in recess , and the sudden overthrow of the rebellion required speedy action .
this grave subject had engaged the attention of mr. lincoln in the last days of his life , and the plan according to which it was to be managed had been prepared and was ready for adoption .
a leading feature of that plan was that it should be carried out by the executive authority , for , so far as i have been informed , neither mr. lincoln nor any member of his cabinet doubted his authority to act or proposed to call an extra session of congress to do the work .
the first business transacted in cabinet after i became president was this unfinished business of my predecessor .
a plan or scheme of reconstruction was produced which had been prepared for mr. lincoln by mr. stanton , his secretary of war .
it was approved , and at the earliest moment practicable was applied in the form of a proclamation to the state of north carolina , and afterwards became the basis of action in turn for the other states .
upon the examination of mr. stanton before the impeachment committee he was asked the following question : 
 " did any one of the cabinet express a doubt of the power of the executive branch of the government to reorganize state governments which had been in rebellion without the aid of congress ? "
he answered : 
 " none whatever .
i had myself entertained no doubt of the authority of the president to take measures for the organization of the rebel states on the plan proposed during the vacation of congress and agreed in the plan specified in the proclamation in the case of north carolina . "
there is perhaps no act of my administration for which i have been more denounced than this .
it was not originated by me , but i shrink from no responsibility on that account , for the plan approved itself to my own judgment , and i did not hesitate to carry it into execution .
thus far and upon this vital policy there was perfect accord between the cabinet and myself , and i saw no necessity for a change .
as time passed on there was developed an unfortunate difference of opinion and of policy between congress and the president upon this same subject and upon the ultimate basis upon which the reconstruction of these states should proceed , especially upon the question of negro suffrage .
upon this point three members of the cabinet found themselves to be in sympathy with congress .
they remained only long enough to see that the difference of policy could not be reconciled .
they felt that they should remain no longer , and a high sense of duty and propriety constrained them to resign their positions .
we parted with mutual respect for the sincerity of each other in opposite opinions , and mutual regret that the difference was on points so vital as to require a severance of official relations .
this was in the summer of 1866 .
the subsequent sessions of congress developed new complications , when the suffrage bill for the district of columbia and the reconstruction acts of march 2 and march 23 , 1867 , all passed over the veto .
it was in cabinet consultations upon these bills that a difference of opinion upon the most vital points was developed .
upon these questions there was perfect accord between all the members of the cabinet and myself , except mr. stanton .
he stood alone , and the difference of opinion could not be reconciled .
that unity of opinion which , upon great questions of public policy or administration , is so essential to the executive was gone .
i do not claim that a head of department should have no other opinions than those of the president .
he has the same right , in the conscientious discharge of duty , to entertain and express his own opinions as has the president .
what i do claim is that the president is the responsible head of the administration , and when the opinions of a head of department are irreconcilably opposed to those of the president in grave matters of policy and administration there is but one result which can solve the difficulty , and that is a severance of the official relation .
this in the past history of the government has always been the rule , and it is a wise one , for such differences of opinion among its members must impair the efficiency of any administration .
i have now referred to the general grounds upon which the withdrawal of mr. stanton from my administration seemed to me to be proper and necessary , but i can not omit to state a special ground , which , if it stood alone , would vindicate my action .
the sanguinary riot which occurred in the city of new orleans on the 30th of august , 1866 , justly aroused public indignation and public inquiry , not only as to those who were engaged in it , but as to those who , more or less remotely , might be held to responsibility for its occurrence .
i need not remind the senate of the effort made to fix that responsibility on the president .
the charge was openly made , and again and again reiterated all through the land , that the president was warned in time , but refused to interfere .
by telegrams from the lieutenant - governor and attorney - general of louisiana , dated the 27th and 28th of august , i was advised that a body of delegates claiming to be a constitutional convention were about to assemble in new orleans ; that the matter was before the grand jury , but that it would be impossible to execute civil process without a riot ; and this question was asked : 
 " is the military to interfere to prevent process of court ? "
this question was asked at a time when the civil courts were in the full exercise of their authority , and the answer sent by telegraph on the same 28th of august was this : 
 " the military will be expected to sustain , and not to interfere with , the proceedings of the courts . "
on the same 28th of august the following telegram was sent to mr. stanton by major - general baird , then ( owing to the absence of general sheridan ) in command of the military at new orleans : 
 hon .
edwin m. stanton , 
 secretary of war : 
 a convention has been called , with the sanction of governor wells , to meet here on monday .
the lieutenant - governor and city authorities think it unlawful , and propose to break it up by arresting the delegates .
i have given no orders on the subject , but have warned the parties that i could not countenance or permit such action without instructions to that effect from the president .
please instruct me at once by telegraph .
the 28th of august was on saturday .
the next morning , the 29th , this dispatch was received by mr. stanton at his residence in this city .
he took no action upon it , and neither sent instructions to general baird himself nor presented it to me for such instructions .
on the next day ( monday ) the riot occurred .
i never saw this dispatch from general baird until some ten days or two weeks after the riot , when , upon my call for all the dispatches , with a view to their publication , mr. stanton sent it to me .
these facts all appear in the testimony of mr. stanton before the judiciary committee in the impeachment investigation .
on the 30th , the day of the riot , and after it was suppressed , general baird wrote to mr. stanton a long letter , from which i make the following extracts : 
 " sir : i have the honor to inform you that a very serious riot has occurred here to - day .
i had not been applied to by the convention for protection , but the lieutenant - governor and the mayor had freely consulted with me , and i was so fully convinced that it was so strongly the intent of the city authorities to preserve the peace , in order to prevent military interference , that i did not regard an outbreak as a thing to be apprehended .
the lieutenant - governor had assured me that even if a writ of arrest was issued by the court the sheriff would not attempt to serve it without my permission , and for to - day they designed to suspend it .
i inclose herewith copies of my correspondence with the mayor and of a dispatch which the lieutenant - governor claims to have received from the president .
i regret that no reply to my dispatch to you of saturday has yet reached me .
general sheridan is still absent in texas . "
the dispatch of general baird of the 28th asks for immediate instructions , and his letter of the 30th , after detailing the terrible riot which had just happened , ends with the expression of regret that the instructions which he asked for were not sent .
it is not the fault or the error or the omission of the president that this military commander was left without instructions ; but for all omissions , for all errors , for all failures to instruct when instruction might have averted this calamity , the president was openly and persistently held responsible .
instantly , without waiting for proof , the delinquency of the president was heralded in every form of utterance .
mr. stanton knew then that the president was not responsible for this delinquency .
the exculpation was in his power , but it was not given by him to the public , and only to the president in obedience to a requisition for all the dispatches .
no one regrets more than myself that general baird 's request was not brought to my notice .
it is clear from his dispatch and letter that if the secretary of war had given him proper instructions the riot which arose on the assembling of the convention would have been averted .
there may be those ready to say that i would have given no instructions even if the dispatch had reached me in time , but all must admit that i ought to have had the opportunity .
the following is the testimony given by mr. stanton before the impeachment investigation committee as to this dispatch : 


 a. i received that dispatch on sunday forenoon .
i examined it carefully , and considered the question presented .
i did not see that i could give any instructions different from the line of action which general baird proposed , and made no answer to the dispatch .
a. that is the date of its reception in the telegraph office saturday night .
i received it on sunday forenoon at my residence .
a copy of the dispatch was furnished to the president several days afterwards , along with all the other dispatches and communications on that subject , but it was not furnished by me before that time .
i suppose it may have been ten or fifteen days afterwards .
o. the president himself being in correspondence with those parties upon the same subject , would it not have been proper to have advised him of the reception of that dispatch ?
a. i know nothing about his correspondence , and know nothing about any correspondence except this one dispatch .
we had intelligence of the riot on thursday morning .
the riot had taken place on monday .
it is a difficult matter to define all the relations which exist between the heads of departments and the president .
the legal relations are well enough defined .
the constitution places these officers in the relation of his advisers when he calls upon them for advice .
the acts of congress go further .
take , for example , the act of 1789 creating the war department .
it provides that-- 
 " there shall be a principal officer therein to be called the secretary for the department of war , who shall perform and execute such duties as shall from time to time be enjoined on or intrusted to him by the president of the united states " and , furthermore , " the said principal officer shall conduct the business of the said department in such manner as the president of the united states shall from time to time order and instruct . "
provision is also made for the appointment of an inferior officer by the head of the department , to be called the chief clerk , " who , whenever said principal officer shall be removed from office by the president of the united states , " shall have the charge and custody of the books , records , and papers of the department .
the legal relation is analogous to that of principal and agent .
it is the president upon whom the constitution devolves , as head of the executive department , the duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed ; but as he can not execute them in person , he is allowed to select his agents , and is made responsible for their acts within just limits .
so complete is this presumed delegation of authority in the relation of a head of department to the president that the supreme court of the united states have decided that an order made by a head of department is presumed to be made by the president himself .
the principal , upon whom such responsibility is placed for the acts of a subordinate , ought to be left as free as possible in the matter of selection and of dismissal .
to hold him to responsibility for an officer beyond his control ; to leave the question of the fitness of such an agent to be decided for him and not by him ; to allow such a subordinate , when the president , moved by " public considerations of a high character , " requests his resignation , to assume for himself an equal right to act upon his own views of " public considerations " and to make his own conclusions paramount to those of the president -- to allow all this is to reverse the just order of administration and to place the subordinate above the superior .
there are , however , other relations between the president and a head of department beyond these defined legal relations , which necessarily attend them , though not expressed .
chief among these is mutual confidence .
this relation is so delicate that it is sometimes hard to say when or how it ceases .
a single flagrant act may end it at once , and then there is no difficulty .
but confidence may be just as effectually destroyed by a series of causes too subtle for demonstration .
as it is a plant of slow growth , so , too , it may be slow in decay .
such has been the process here .
i will not pretend to say what acts or omissions have broken up this relation .
they are hardly susceptible of statement , and still less of formal proof .
nevertheless , no one can read the correspondence of the 5th of august without being convinced that this relation was effectually gone on both sides , and that while the president was unwilling to allow mr. stanton to remain in his administration , mr. stanton was equally unwilling to allow the president to carry on his administration without his presence .
in the great debate which took place in the house of representatives in 1789 , in the first organization of the principal departments , mr. madison spoke as follows : 
 " it is evidently the intention of the constitution that the first magistrate should be responsible for the executive department .
so far , therefore , as we do not make the officers who are to aid him in the duties of that department responsible to him , he is not responsible to the country .
again : is there no danger that an officer , when he is appointed by the concurrence of the senate and has friends in that body , may choose rather to risk his establishment on the favor of that branch than rest it upon the discharge of his duties to the satisfaction of the executive branch , which is constitutionally authorized to inspect and control his conduct ?
and if it should happen that the officers connect themselves with the senate , they may mutually support each other , and for want of efficacy reduce the power of the president to a vapor , in which case his responsibility would be annihilated , and the expectation of it is unjust .
the high executive officers , joined in cabal with the senate , would lay the foundation of discord , and end in an assumption of the executive power only to be removed by a revolution in the government . "
mr. sedgwick , in the same debate , referring to the proposition that a head of department should only be removed or suspended by the concurrence of the senate , used this language : 
 " but if proof be necessary , what is then the consequence ?
why , in nine cases out of ten , where the case is very dear to the mind of the president that the man ought to be removed , the effect can not be produced , because it is absolutely impossible to produce the necessary evidence .
are the senate to proceed without evidence ?
some gentlemen contend not .
then the object will be lost .
shall a man under these circumstances be saddled upon the president who has been appointed for no other purpose but to aid the president in performing certain duties ?
shall he be continued , i ask again , against the will of the president ?
if he is , where is the responsibility ?
are you to look for it in the president , who has no control over the officer , no power to remove him if he acts unfeelingly or unfaithfully ?
without you make him responsible you weaken and destroy the strength and beauty of your system .
what is to be done in cases which can only be known from a long acquaintance with the conduct of an officer ? "
i had indulged the hope that upon the assembling of congress mr. stanton would have ended this unpleasant complication according to his intimation given in his note of august 12 .
the duty which i have felt myself called upon to perform was by no means agreeable , but i feel that i am not responsible for the controversy or for the consequences .
unpleasant as this necessary change in my cabinet has been to me upon personal considerations , i have the consolation to be assured that so far as the public interests are involved there is no cause for regret .
salutary reforms have been introduced by the secretary ad interim and great reductions of expenses have been effected under his administration of the war department , to the saving of millions to the treasury .

 i. all enlisted men of the rebel army and petty officers and seamen of the rebel navy will be discharged upon taking the oath of allegiance .
ii .
officers of the rebel army not above the grade of captain and of the rebel navy not above the grade of lieutenant , except such as have graduated at the united states military or naval academies and such as held a commission in either the united states army or navy at the beginning of the rebellion , may be discharged upon taking the oath of allegiance .

by order of the president of the united states : 
 e. d. townsend , 
 assistant adjutant - general .

whereas by an act of congress approved march 3 , 1865 , there was established in the war department a bureau of refugees , freedmen , and abandoned lands , and to which , in accordance with the said act of congress , is committed the supervision and management of all abandoned lands and the control of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen from rebel states , or from any district of country within the territory embraced in the operations of the army , under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the head of the bureau and approved by the president ; and 
 whereas it appears that the management of abandoned lands and subjects relating to refugees and freedmen , as aforesaid , have been and still are , by orders based on military exigencies or legislation based on previous statutes , partly in the hands of military officers disconnected with said bureau and partly in charge of officers of the treasury department : it is therefore 
 ordered , that all officers of the treasury department , all military officers , and all others in the service of the united states turn over to the authorized officers of said bureau all abandoned lands and property contemplated in said act of congress approved march 3 , 1865 , establishing the bureau of refugees , freedmen , and abandoned lands , that may now be under or within their control .
they will also turn over to such officers all funds collected by tax or otherwise for the benefit of refugees or freedmen or accruing from abandoned lands or property set apart for their use , and will transfer to them all official records connected with the administration of affairs which pertain to said bureau .

to the house of representatives : 
 in compliance with the resolution adopted yesterday by the house of representatives , requesting any further correspondence the president " may have had with general u. s. grant , in addition to that heretofore submitted , on the subject of the recent vacation by the latter of the war office , " i transmit herewith a copy of a communication addressed to general grant on the 10th instant , together with a copy of the accompanying papers .
andrew johnson .
executive mansion , february 10 , 1868 .
general u. s. grant , 
 commanding armies of the united states , washington , d. c. 
 general : the extraordinary character of your letter of the 3d instant would seem to preclude any reply on my part ; but the manner in which publicity has been given to the correspondence of which that letter forms a part and the grave questions which are involved induce me to take this mode of giving , as a proper sequel to the communications which have passed between us , the statements of the five members of the cabinet who were present on the occasion of our conversation on the 14th ultimo .
copies of the letters which they have addressed to me upon the subject are accordingly herewith inclosed .
you speak of my letter of the 31st ultimo as a reiteration of the " many and gross misrepresentations " contained in certain newspaper articles , and reassert the correctness of the statements contained in your communication of the 28th ultimo , adding -- and here i give your own words--"anything in yours in reply to it to the contrary notwithstanding . "
when a controversy upon matters of fact reaches the point to which this has been brought , further assertion or denial between the immediate parties should cease , especially where upon either side it loses the character of the respectful discussion which is required by the relations in which the parties stand to each other and degenerates in tone and temper .
in such a case , if there is nothing to rely upon but the opposing statements , conclusions must be drawn from those statements alone and from whatever intrinsic probabilities they afford in favor of or against either of the parties .
i should not shrink from this test in this controversy ; but , fortunately , it is not left to this test alone .
there were five cabinet officers present at the conversation the detail of which in my letter of the 28th ( 31st ) ultimo you allow yourself to say contains " many and gross misrepresentations . "
these gentlemen heard that conversation and have read my statement .
they speak for themselves , and i leave the proof without a word of comment .
i deem it proper before concluding this communication to notice some of the statements contained in your letter .
you say that a performance of the promises alleged to have been made by you to the president " would have involved a resistance to law and an inconsistency with the whole history of my connection with the suspension of mr. stanton . "
you then state that you had fears the president would , on the removal of mr. stanton , appoint someone in his place who would embarrass the army in carrying out the reconstruction acts , and add : 
 " it was to prevent such an appointment that i accepted the office of secretary of war ad interim , and not for the purpose of enabling you to get rid of mr. stanton by withholding it from him in opposition to law , or , not doing so myself , surrendering it to one who would , as the statements and assumptions in your communication plainly indicate was sought . "
first of all , you here admit that from the very beginning of what you term " the whole history " of your connection with mr. stanton 's suspension you intended to circumvent the president .
it was to carry out that intent that you accepted the appointment .
this was in your mind at the time of your acceptance .
it was not , then , in obedience to the order of your superior , as has heretofore been supposed , that you assumed the duties of the office .
you knew it was the president 's purpose to prevent mr. stanton from resuming the office of secretary of war , and you intended to defeat that purpose .
you accepted the office , not in the interest of the president but of mr. stanton .
if this purpose , so entertained by you , had been confined to yourself ; if when accepting the office you had done so with a mental reservation to frustrate the president , it would have been a tacit deception .
in the ethics of some persons such a course is allowable .
but you can not stand even upon that questionable ground .
the " history " of your connection with this transaction , as written by yourself , places you in a different predicament , and shows that you not only concealed your design from the president , but induced him to suppose that you would carry out his purpose to keep mr. stanton out of office by retaining it yourself after an attempted restoration by the senate , so as to require mr. stanton to establish his right by judicial decision .
i now give that part of this " history " as written by yourself in your letter of the 28th ultimo : 
 " some time after i assumed the duties of secretary of war ad interim the president asked me my views as to the course mr. stanton would have to pursue , in case the senate should not concur in his suspension , to obtain possession of his office .
my reply was , in substance , that mr. stanton would have to appeal to the courts to reinstate him , illustrating my position by citing the ground i had taken in the case of the baltimore police commissioners . "
now , at that time , as you admit in your letter of the 3d instant , you held the office for the very object of defeating an appeal to the courts .
in that letter you say that in accepting the office one motive was to prevent the president from appointing some other person who would retain possession , and thus make judicial proceedings necessary .
you knew the president was unwilling to trust the office with anyone who would not by holding it compel mr. stanton to resort to the courts .
you perfectly understood that in this interview , " some time " after you accepted the office , the president , not content with your silence , desired an expression of your views , and you answered him that mr. stanton " would have to appeal to the courts . "
if the president reposed confidence before he knew your views , and that confidence had been violated , it might have been said he made a mistake ; but a violation of confidence reposed after that conversation was no mistake of his nor of yours .
it is the fact only that needs be stated , that at the date of this conversation you did not intend to hold the office with the purpose of forcing mr. stanton into court , but did hold it then and had accepted it to prevent that course from being carried out .
in other words , you said to the president , " that is the proper course , " and you said to yourself , " i have accepted this office , and now hold it to defeat that course . "
the excuse you make in a subsequent paragraph of that letter of the 28th ultimo , that afterwards you changed your views as to what would be a proper course , has nothing to do with the point now under consideration .
the point is that before you changed your views you had secretly determined to do the very thing which at last you did surrender the office to mr. stanton .
you may have changed your views as to the law , but you certainly did not change your views as to the course you had marked out for yourself from the beginning .
i will only notice one more statement in your letter of the 3d instant -- that the performance of the promises which it is alleged were made by you would have involved you in the resistance of law .
i know of no statute that would have been violated had you , carrying out your promises in good faith , tendered your resignation when you concluded not to be made a party in any legal proceedings .
you add : 
 " i am in a measure confirmed in this conclusion by your recent orders directing me to disobey orders from the secretary of war , my superior and your subordinate , without having countermanded his authority to issue the orders i am to disobey . "
on the 24th ultimo you addressed a note to the president requesting in writing an order given to you verbally five days before to disregard orders from mr. stanton as secretary of war until you " knew from the president himself that they were his orders . "
on the 29th , in compliance with your request , i did give you instructions in writing " not to obey any order from the war department assumed to be issued by the direction of the president unless such order is known by the general commanding the armies of the united states to have been authorized by the executive . "
there are some orders which a secretary of war may issue without the authority of the president , there are others which he issues simply as the agent of the president , and which purport to be " by direction " of the president .
for such orders the president is responsible , and he should therefore know and understand what they are before giving such " direction . "
mr. stanton states in his letter of the 4th instant , which accompanies the published correspondence , that he " has had no correspondence with the president since the 12th of august last ; " and he further says that since he resumed the duties of the office he has continued to discharge them " without any personal or written communication with the president ; " and he adds , " no orders have been issued from this department in the name of the president with my knowledge , and i have received no orders from him . "
it thus seems that mr. stanton now discharges the duties of the war department without any reference to the president and without using his name .
my order to you had only reference to orders " assumed to be issued by the direction of the president . "
it would appear from mr. stanton 's letter that you have received no such orders from him .
however , in your note to the president of the 30th ultimo , in which you acknowledge the receipt of the written order of the 29th , you say that you have been informed by mr. stanton that he has not received any order limiting his authority to issue orders to the army , according to the practice of the department , and state that " while this authority to the war department is not countermanded it will be satisfactory evidence to me that any orders issued from the war department by direction of the president are authorized by the executive . "
the president issues an order to you to obey no order from the war department purporting to be made " by the direction of the president " until you have referred it to him for his approval .
you reply that you have received the president 's order and will not obey it , but will obey an order purporting to be given by his direction if it comes from the war department .
you will not obey the direct order of the president , but will obey his indirect order .
if , as you say , there has been a practice in the war department to issue orders in the name of the president without his direction , does not the precise order you have requested and have received change the practice as to the general of the army ?
could not the president countermand any such order issued to you from the war department ?
if you should receive an order from that department , issued in the name of the president , to do a special act , and an order directly from the president himself not to do the act , is there a doubt which you are to obey ?
you answer the question when you say to the president , in your letter of the 3d instant , the secretary of war is " my superior and your subordinate , " and yet you refuse obedience to the superior out of a deference to the subordinate .
without further comment upon the insubordinate attitude which you have assumed , i am at a loss to know how you can relieve yourself from obedience to the orders of the president , who is made by the constitution the commander in chief of the army and navy , and is therefore the official superior as well of the general of the army as of the secretary of war .
respectfully , yours , 
 andrew johnson .
( letter addressed to each of the members of the cabinet present at the conversation between the president and general grant on the 14th of january , 1868 , and answers thereto . )
executive mansion , 
 washington , d. c. , february 5 , 1868 .
sir : the chronicle of this morning contains a correspondence between the president and general grant reported from the war department in answer to a resolution of the house of representatives .
i beg to call your attention to that correspondence , and especially to that part of it which refers to the conversation between the president and general grant at the cabinet meeting on tuesday , the 14th of january , and to request you to state what was said in that conversation .
very respectfully , yours , 
 andrew johnson .
washington , d. c. , february 5 , 1868 .
the president .
sir : your note of this date was handed to me this evening .
my recollection of the conversation at the cabinet meeting on tuesday , the 14th of january , corresponds with your statement of it in the letter of the 31st ultimo in the published correspondence .
the three points specified in that letter , giving your recollection of the conversation , are correctly stated .
very respectfully , 
 gideon welles .
treasury department , february 6 , 1868 .
the president .
sir : i have received your note of the 5th instant , calling my attention to the correspondence between yourself and general grant as published in the chronicle of yesterday , especially to that part of it which relates to what occurred at the cabinet meeting on tuesday , the 14th ultimo , and requesting me to state what was said in the conversation referred to .
i can not undertake to state the precise language used , but i have no hesitation in saying that your account of that conversation as given in your letter to general grant under date of the 31st ultimo substantially and in all important particulars accords with my recollection of it .
with great respect , your obedient servant , 
 hugh mcculloch .
post - office department , 
 washington , february , 6 , 1868 .
the president .
sir : i am in receipt of your letter of the 5th of february , calling my attention to the correspondence published in the chronicle between the president and general grant , and especially to that part of it which refers to the conversation between the president and general grant at the cabinet meeting on tuesday , the 14th of january , with a request that state what was said in that conversation .
in reply i have the honor to state that i have read carefully the correspondence in question , and particularly the letter of the president to general grant dated january 31 , 1868 .
the following extract from your letter of the 31st january to general grant is , according to my recollection , a correct statement of the conversation that took place between the president and general grant at the cabinet meeting on the 14th of january last .
in the presence of the cabinet the president asked general grant whether , " in conversation which took place after his appointment as secretary of war ad interim , he did not agree either to remain at the head of the war department and abide any judicial proceedings that might follow the nonconcurrence by the senate in mr. stanton 's suspension , or , should he wish not to become involved in such a controversy , to put the president in the same position with respect to the office as be occupied previous to general grant 's appointment , by returning it to the president in time to anticipate such action by the senate . "
this general grant admitted .
the president then asked general grant if at the conference on the preceding saturday he had not , to avoid misunderstanding , requested general grant to state what he intended to do , and , further , if in reply to that inquiry he ( general grant ) had not referred to their former conversations , saying that from them the president understood his position , and that his ( general grant 's ) action would be consistent with the understanding which had been reached .
to these questions general grant replied in the affirmative .
the president asked general grant if at the conclusion of their interview on saturday it was not understood that they were to have another conference on monday before final action by the senate in the case of mr. stanton .
general grant replied that such was the understanding , but that he did not suppose the senate would act so soon ; that on monday he had been engaged in a conference with general sherman , and was occupied with " many little matters , " and asked if general sherman had not called on that day .
i take this mode of complying with the request contained in the president 's letter to me , because my attention had been called to the subject before , when the conversation between the president and general grant was under consideration .
very respectfully , your obedient servant , 
 alex .
w. randall , 
 postmaster - general .
department of the interior , 
 washington , d. c. , february 6 , 1868 .
the president .
sir : i am in receipt of yours of yesterday , calling my attention to a correspondence between yourself and general grant published in the chronicle newspaper , and especially to that part of said correspondence " which refers to the conversation between the president and general grant at the cabinet meeting on tuesday , the 14th of january , " and requesting me " to state what was said in that conversation . "
in reply i submit the following statement : at the cabinet meeting on tuesday , the 14th of january , 1868 , general grant appeared and took his accustomed seat at the board .
when he had been reached in the order of business , the president asked him , as usual , if he had anything to present .
in reply the general , after referring to a note which he had that morning addressed to the president , inclosing a copy of the resolution of the senate refusing to concur in the reasons for the suspension of mr. stanton , proceeded to say that he regarded his duties as secretary of war ad interim terminated by that resolution , and that he could not lawfully exercise such duties for a moment after the adoption of the resolution by the senate ; that the resolution reached him last night , and that this morning he had gone to the war department , entered the secretary 's room , bolted one door on the inside , locked the other on the outside , delivered the key to the adjutant - general , and proceeded to the headquarters of the army and addressed the note above mentioned to the president , informing him that he ( general grant ) was no longer secretary of war ad interim .
the president expressed great surprise at the course which general grant had thought proper to pursue , and , addressing himself to the general , proceeded to say , in substance , that he had anticipated such action on the part of the senate , and , being very desirous to have the constitutionality of the tenure - of - office bill tested and his fight to suspend or remove a member of the cabinet decided by the judicial tribunals of the country he had some time ago , and shortly after general grant 's appointment as secretary of war ad interim , asked the general what his action would be in the event that the senate should refuse to concur in the suspension of mr. stanton , and that the general had then agreed either to remain at the head of the war department till a decision could be obtained from the court or resign the office into the hands of the president before the case was acted upon by the senate , so as to place the president in the same situation he occupied at the time of his ( grant 's ) appointment .
the president further said that the conversation was renewed on the preceding saturday , at which time he asked the general what he intended to do if the senate should undertake to reinstate mr. stanton , in reply to which the general referred to their former conversation upon the same subject and said : " you understand my position , and my conduct will be conformable to that understanding ; " that he ( the general ) then expressed a repugnance to being made a party to a judicial proceeding , saying that he would expose himself to fine and imprisonment by doing so , as his continuing to discharge the duties of secretary of war ad interim after the senate should have refused to concur in the suspension of mr. stanton would be a violation of the tenure - of - office bill ; that in reply to this he ( the president ) informed general grant he had not suspended mr. stanton under the tenure - of - office bill , but by virtue of the powers conferred on him by the constitution ; and that , as to the fine and imprisonment , he ( the president ) would pay whatever fine was imposed and submit to whatever imprisonment might be adjudged against him ( the general ) ; that they continued the conversation for some time , discussing the law at length , and that they finally separated without having reached a definite conclusion , and with the understanding that the general would see the president again on monday .
in reply general grant admitted that the conversations had occurred , and said that at the first conversation he had given it as his opinion to the president that in the event of nonconcurrence by the senate in the action of the president in respect to the secretary of war the question would have to be decided by the court -- that mr. stanton would have to appeal to the court to reinstate him in office ; that the ins would remain in till they could be displaced and the outs put in by legal proceedings ; and that he then thought so , and had agreed that if he should change his mind he would notify the president in time to enable him to make another appointment , but that at the time of the first conversation he had not looked very closely into the law ; that it had recently been discussed by the newspapers , and that this had induced him to examine it more carefully , and that he had come to the conclusion that if the senate should refuse to concur in the suspension mr. stanton would thereby be reinstated , and that he ( grant ) could not continue thereafter to act as secretary of war ad interim without subjecting himself to fine and imprisonment , and that he came over on saturday to inform the president of this change in his views , and did so inform him ; that the president replied that be had not suspended mr. stanton under the tenure - of - office bill , but under the constitution , and had appointed him ( grant ) by virtue of the authority derived from the constitution , etc ; that they continued to discuss the matter some time , and finally he left , without any conclusion having been reached , expecting to see the president again on monday .
he then proceeded to explain why he had not called on the president on monday , saying that he had had a long interview with general sherman , that various little matters had occupied his time till it was late , and that he did not think the senate would act so soon , and asked : " did not general sherman call on you on monday ? "
i do not know what passed between the president and general grant on saturday , except as i learned it from the conversation between them at the cabinet meeting on tuesday , and the foregoing is substantially what then occurred .
the precise words used on the occasion are not , of course , given exactly in the order in which they were spoken , but the ideas expressed and the facts stated are faithfully preserved and presented .
i have the honor to be , sir , with great respect , your obedient servant , 
 o. h. browning .
department of state .
washington , february 6 , 1868 .
the president .
sir : the meeting to which you refer in your letter was a regular cabinet meeting .
while the members were assembling , and before the president had entered the council chamber , general grant on coming in said to me that he was in attendance there , not as a member of the cabinet , but upon invitation , and i replied by the inquiry whether there was a change in the war department .
after the president had taken his seat , business went on in the usual way of hearing matters submitted by the several secretaries .
when the time came for the secretary of war , general grant said that he was now there , not as secretary of war , but upon the president 's invitation ; that he had retired from the war department .
a slight difference then appeared about the supposed invitation , general grant saying that the officer who had borne his letter to the president that morning announcing his retirement from the war department had told him that the president desired to see him at the cabinet , to which the president answered that when general grant 's communication was delivered to him the president simply replied that he supposed general grant would be very soon at the cabinet meeting .
i regarded the conversation thus begun as an incidental one .
it went on quite informally , and consisted of a statement on your part of your views in regard to the understanding of the tenure upon which general grant had assented to hold the war department ad interim and of his replies by way of answer and explanation .
it was respectful and courteous on both sides .
being in this conversational form , its details could only have been preserved by verbatim report .
so far as i know , no such report was made at the time .
i can give only the general effect of the conversation .
certainly you stated that , although you had reported the reasons for mr. stanton 's suspension to the senate , you nevertheless held that he would not be entitled to resume the office of secretary of war even if the senate should disapprove of his suspension , and that you had proposed to have the question tested by judicial process , to be applied to the person who should be the incumbent of the department under your designation of secretary of war ad interim in the place of mr. stanton .
you contended that this was well understood between yourself and general grant ; that when he entered the war department as secretary ad interim he expressed his concurrence in a belief that the question of mr. stanton 's restoration would be a question for the courts ; that in a subsequent conversation with general grant you had adverted to the understanding thus had , and that general grant expressed his concurrence in it ; that at some conversation which had been previously held general grant said he still adhered to the same construction of the law , but said if he should change his opinion he would give you seasonable notice of it , so that you should in any case be placed in the same position in regard to the war department that you were while general grant held it ad interim .
i did not understand general grant as denying nor as explicitly admitting these statements in the form and full extent to which you made them .
his admission of them was rather indirect and circumstantial , though i did not understand it to be an evasive one .
he said that , reasoning from what occurred in the case of the police in maryland , which he regarded as a parallel one , he was of opinion , and so assured you , that it would be his right and duty under your instructions to hold the war office after the senate should disapprove of mr. stanton 's suspension until the question should be decided upon by the courts ; that he remained until very recently of that opinion , and that on the saturday before the cabinet meeting a conversation was held between yourself and him in which the subject was generally discussed .
general grant 's statement was that in that conversation he had stated to you the legal difficulties which might arise , involving fine and imprisonment , under the civil - tenure bill , and that he did not care to subject himself to those penalties ; that you replied to this remark that you regarded the civil - tenure bill as unconstitutional and did not think its penalties were to be feared , or that you would voluntarily assume them ; and you insisted that general grant should either retain the office until relieved by yourself , according to what you claimed was the original understanding between yourself and him , or , by seasonable notice of change of purpose on his part , put you in the same situation which you would be if he adhered .
you claimed that general grant finally said in that saturday 's conversation that you understood his views , and his proceedings thereafter would be consistent with what had been so understood .
general grant did not controvert , nor can i say that he admitted , this last statement .
certainly general grant did not at any time in the cabinet meeting insist that he had in the saturday 's conversation , either distinctly or finally , advised you of his determination to retire from the charge of the war department otherwise than under your own subsequent direction .
he acquiesced in your statement that the saturday 's conversation ended with an expectation that there would be a subsequent conference on the subject , which he , as well as yourself , supposed could seasonably take place on monday .
you then alluded to the fact that general grant did not call upon you on monday , as you had expected from that conversation .
general grant admitted that it was his expectation or purpose to call upon you on monday .
general grant assigned reasons for the omission .
he said he was in conference with general sherman ; that there were many little matters to be attended to ; he had conversed upon the matter of the incumbency of the war department with general sherman , and he expected that general sherman would call upon you on monday .
my own mind suggested a further explanation , but i do not remember whether it was mentioned or not , namely , that it was not supposed by general grant on monday that the senate would decide the question so promptly as to anticipate further explanation between yourself and him if delayed beyond that day .
general grant made another explanation -- that he was engaged on sunday with general sherman , and i think , also , on monday , in regard to the war department matter , with a hope , though he did not say in an effort , to procure an amicable settlement of the affair of mr. stanton , and he still hoped that it would be brought about .
i have the honor to be , with great respect , your obedient servant , 
 william h. seward .
february 11 1868 
 to the house of representatives : 
 the accompanying letter from general grant , received since the transmission to the house of representatives of my communication of this date , is submitted to the house as a part of the correspondence referred to in the resolution of the 10th instant .
andrew johnson .
headquarters army of the united states , 
 washington , d. c. , february 11 , 1868 .
his excellency a. johnson , president of the united states .
sir : i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 10th instant , accompanied by statements of five cabinet ministers of their recollection of what occurred in cabinet meeting on the 14th of january .
without admitting anything in these statements where they differ from anything heretofore stated by me , i propose to notice only that portion of your communication wherein i am charged with insubordination .
i think it will be plain to the reader of my letter of the 30th of january that i did not propose to disobey any legal order of the president distinctly given , but only gave an interpretation of what would be regarded as satisfactory evidence of the president 's sanction to orders communicated by the secretary of war .
i will say here that your letter of the 10th instant contains the first intimation i have had that you did not accept that interpretation .
now for reasons for giving that interpretation .
it was clear to me before my letter of january 30 was written that i , the person having more public business to transact with the secretary of war than any other of the president 's subordinates , was the only one who had been instructed to disregard the authority of mr. stanton where his authority was derived as agent of the president .
on the 27th of january i received a letter from the secretary of war ( copy herewith ) directing me to furnish escort to public treasure from the rio grande to new orleans , etc . ,
at the request of the secretary of the treasury to him .
i also send two other inclosures , showing recognition of mr. stanton as secretary of war by both the secretary of the .
treasury and the postmaster - general , in all of which cases the secretary of war had to call upon me to make the orders requested or give the information desired , and where his authority to do so is derived , in my view , as agent of the president .
with an order so clearly ambiguous as that of the president here referred to , it was my duty to inform the president of my interpretation of it and to abide by that interpretation until i received other orders .
disclaiming any intention , now or heretofore , of disobeying any legal order of the president distinctly communicated , 
 i remain , very respectfully , your obedient servant , 
 u. s. grant , general .
war department , 
 washington city , january 27 , 1868 .
general u. s. grant , 
 commanding army united states .
general : the secretary of the treasury has requested this department to afford a. f. randall , special agent of the treasury department , such military aid as may be necessary to secure and forward for deposit from brownsville , tex . ,
to new orleans public moneys in possession of custom - house officers at brownsville , and which are deemed insecure at that place .
you will please give such directions as you may deem proper to the officer commanding at brownsville to carry into effect the request of the treasury department , the instructions to be sent by telegraph to galveston , to the care of a. f. randall , special agent , who is at galveston waiting telegraphic orders , there being no telegraphic communication with brownsville , and the necessity for military protection to the public moneys represented as urgent .
please favor me with a copy of such instructions as you may give , in order that they may be communicated to the secretary of the treasury .
yours , truly , 
 edwin m. stanton , 
 secretary of war .
post - office department , contract office , 
 washington , february 3 , 1868 .
the honorable the secretary of war .
sir : it has been represented to this department that in october last a military commission was appointed to settle upon some general plan of defense for the texas frontiers , and that the said commission has made a report recommending a line of posts from the rio grande to the red river .

the honorable secretary of war .
sir : it is represented to this department that a band of robbers has obtained such a foothold in the section of country between humboldt and lawrence , kans. , committing depredations upon travelers , both by public and private conveyance , that the safety of the public money collected by the receiver of the land office at humboldt requires that it should be guarded during its transit from humboldt to lawrence .
i have therefore the honor to request that the proper commanding officer of the district may be instructed by the war department , if in the opinion of the honorable secretary of war it can be done without prejudice to the public interests , to furnish a sufficient military guard to protect such moneys as may be in transitu from the above office for the purpose of being deposited to the credit of the treasurer of the united states .
as far as we are now advised , such service will not be necessary oftener than once a month .
will you please advise me of the action taken , that i may instruct the receiver and the commissioner of the general land office in the matter ?
very respectfully , your obedient servant ,
